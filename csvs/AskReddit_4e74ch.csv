The deficit in understanding my neurotypical parents tended to show was often just as profound as my twin's, sometimes more. Often what I noticed is that she's the one who saw certain things with a clarity that they didn't have -- for example, what a waste of time and energy many of the social expectations society places on people really are. She exists in a world with rules that *objectively make no sense* that people just keep telling her are important (because they are, but for ""bad"" reasons, like ""tradition"" and ""expectations""), and it's not that she doesn't understand what they're saying and needs them to keep explaining it, but that she hears them, considers it critically, and rejects it.

"Finally, seeing a thread where Autism Speaks is slammed :)   Asides from the deserved criticism of Autism Speaks, I would like people to know the following things:   - Although it is hard being autistic, it is not the fault of my being autistic. It is the fault of how I am treated due to that, there is nothing inherently wrong with me - a difference in neurology does not constitute an error.  -  Comorbidities. Yeah, I am autistic, but I also have OCD and some vague palsy like muscle issues as well as ulcerative colitis. People can have more than more thing, and it doesn't necessarily mean they are related- example; my anxiety is related, but my muscle tension/pain issues are not.  - Autism is not a condition that comes necessarily with intellectual disability, it can do and that's fine, but to assume every autistic person is afflicted with such a thing because of a socual deficit is really uncool.   The thing that has caused most trouble for me recently is a seeming inability to communicate with people. I worried that this was some sort of regression, but it has since been brought to my attention (by more socially adept friends) that the communication problems lie with those who are talking to me, because they are talking to me like a child and seem unable to understand that social/communicative deficit does not equal intelligence deficit.

"That I don't need or want you playing ""diagnosis police"".

The result is that these people almost certainly cause significantly more harm to autistic people than any alleged fakers. Aside from the obvious traumatic impact to the alleged faker (who often is actually autistic as there are huge numbers of undiagnosed adults who have limited access to diagnosis resources), this constant questioning of people's diagnosis status impacts those of us who have been diagnosed as well.  It creates an atmosphere where we are constantly questioned on the validity of our diagnosis, where we are never taken as authorities on our own mental state, and where the burden of proof rests entirely on us (which we are often demanded to meet by complete strangers to satisfy nothing more than a whim).

"My observation is that Autism is (or at least certainly appears) most difficult for those raised by neurotypical parents and who are under pressure to be ""normal"".  If you treat autism like something that can be cured (rather than coped with) it creates the wrong expectations and doesn't help the child in the long run.  I can only speak for myself, but being raised by parents who were also on the spectrum allowed them to share life experiences with me that I needed.  Most of my family has Asperger's, or undiagnosed Asperger's traits.  They understood because they grew up with the same challenges I had, and they could share what worked for them.  The difference it made was tremendous.  I didn't feel like an outcast in my own home, and they were able to help me adjust to the simple idea ""We were born on the wrong planet.  It's their world, and this is how you survive in it.""  As a result we've all done pretty well for ourselves.  I'm a 3rd generation government contractor and we've all been involved in some form of engineering or software development.  Part of ""how you survive"" is finding the jobs that match our minds, and speaking to machines comes more naturally than speaking to people.  The sad irony is that the few neurotypical kids born into the family have struggled to fit in with the rest of us.  We jokingly call them ""the white sheep"" of the family, but it's true.  Our white sheep have completely separate social circles from the rest of us and live a life that most of the family just doesn't understand.

I'm very high functioning and a lot of the things that I do as a result of my autism are often regarded as me being anti social at best and a complete asshole at worst.",AskReddit_4e74ch.csv,0.9227607846260071,"['NEGATIVE', 0.01293688639998436, 0.8171605467796326, 0.1698663830757141, 3.6234137951396406e-05]"
"I made this account for my brother and he wants to say some things. This is verbatim from him speaking:  I am different. That I have some difficulty with communication skills but I think of certain subjects that I really like so much. It's just me how to communicate people and how I see things differently.   I'm proud because I am what I am and I am a human being. I would like to try to learn to communicate and be in relationships with people, relationships with women, but I always feel like I will say something without realizing it that will be an effect of my disability.

"Emotions. People tend to think I'm emotionless or careless, but the real truth is, I feel way too much at once. And when it starts, I'm stone cold numb from the surreal nature of the situation. After a couple of weeks or so it gets heavier and heavier and I tend to have outbursts or breakdowns.  I fucking hate it. It ruins my relationships, and it also eats my mind away with constant questioning, and my anxiety triples as I constantly feel like fucking vomiting.

"A few questions to the autistic folks out there:  My 6 year old daughter is mildly autistic.  We've known since about 18 mos old and have since had her in intensive therapy, developmental preschool, etc. and she's done very well.  She's not gifted intellectually but she is above average in regular public school and so far is doing pretty good.  Is there anyway to make any sort of prediction of how she'll turn out in the next 5 or 10 years?  I've heard from other parents of relatively high functioning autistic kids that the time around puberty is immensely stressful, more so than typical kids.  Is this your experience too, or not?  I spoke with a high functioning adult about this stuff a while back and he said that a lot of the therapy is directed toward normalizing behavior which he felt was kinda a waste of time.  Any comments?  What do you guys think about?  What's in your mind?  My daughter is fairly bright and is affectionate with the people that she really enjoys (close family and ""friends"" only) but she does not verbalize many of her thoughts, has great difficulty telling us a narrative about what happened during a day at school, etc.  Furthermore, she enjoys being around other kids and can play around them, but a give-and-take interaction just doesn't happen very often.  She doesn't complain about any of the kids in her class, but i don't feel like any of them are actually her ""friend"". Can we reasonably expect any of this to ""improve""?  Sorry, that was too much.  If any of you autistic folks have any comments, it'd be appreciated.",AskReddit_4e74ch.csv,0.9969478249549866,"['POSITIVE', 0.7226547598838806, 0.041034188121557236, 0.2361469268798828, 0.00016413643606938422]"
"My biggest issue is always just getting people to listen to what I need at the moment, because depending on stress, mood etc it can be easier or harder to deal with stuff.   If I say please don't touch me, please don't touch me. Chances are I'm already over stimulated and am having trouble dealing with everything going on in my head and that's the last thing I need. If I'm anxious I physically feel pain when someone touches me.  Or like just asking for subtitles on. Is it really that hard to just put them on without playing 20 questions? If your friend asks for subtitles on then they probably need them, even if you think they don't. I have a hard time hearing and interpreting words so if there is too much background noise or it's too fast paced it's really helpful to have subtitles on to keep up. But it's not always comfortable outing myself to people because people tend to look at you differently you know? And I'd rather it get brought up later one on one not in a room full of people wanting to just get the movie started.  tl:dr Respect that if someone says they need something for their own wellbeing/enjoyment, they probably need it and it's none of your business.",AskReddit_4e74ch.csv,0.9972795844078064,"['POSITIVE', 0.7080049514770508, 0.15746283531188965, 0.13175414502620697, 0.0027781042736023664]"
