I was diagnosed with aspergers at the age of 11.  I feel like I'm part of a play where everyone has the script except me.
You know that time you said something stupid and everyone looked at you like you grew a second head? Imagine feeling like that everytime you talk to someone.    Iama high functioning autist ama
"Social interactions that come to others naturally, require a lot of thought and planning in my situation. For lack of a better analogy, I have mental checklists for every social event under the sun.  Obsessions are amped up from non-autistic people,as are following rituals, every night when I get home, I have dinner, and watch the Simpsons, no ifs ands or buts.  I work as a chef, and my supervisor and I have a certain codeword (traffic) that if I mention it out of the blue , it means 'I need to cool off for a few, I'm getting overloaded here.'  I've got more to post, but I'm also working breakfast, so I'll leave it for now.  Edit-wow. Did not expect this to blow up so fast. Naturally, I don't have time to answer every question (sorry...),so I'll explain a few things that'll hopefully clear up most, if not all of the questions-   1. The kitchen environment is fairly stressful, but we have a great team that I know has my back, and we have a fairly simple menu, so it's more a high volume of orders that's stressful. My supervisor/head chef is a great guy, and I had the foresight to mention that I have autism the first service we worked. (It's a fairly new place, so we were there together from day one.) We often hang out outside of work, so we are pretty in touch with each other. He's not a pushover though, so I know not to take a break if we are deep in the weeds. Since we opened mid-October, I've only had to use the code word once (Admittedly, he soon followed me in banging our heads against the door after an unusually bad experience with an apprentice). We have the sort of relationship where we joke around with each other, he calls me Gump, I make fun of his misspelled arm tattoo, that sort of thing.  2. Social interactions- when I say mental checklists, it's more like a dichotomous key in my head, that's really drawn out. For example, I frequent my local nightclub, so my checklist may read as follows-  Nice security guard- light banter,don't get startled by the joke noogy  Jerk security guard- I.D, don't hang about. Bar quiet- engage bartender in conversation, ask for cocktail Bar packed- just order. Women animated in conversation- leave them be. Women bored/lonely looking/ smiling at me- approach and engage in banter/attempt pick up line. etc.  All this is almost in a robotic voice in my psyche, ie. not natural at all.  3. My routine. If my routine is disturbed, I get moody, but it's not a catastrophe . Of course if I'm not at home,or something comes up, I've learned to let it go, but if possible, I follow the routine to a T.  Lastly, if you are unsure whether or not you have autism, please ask a professional, when diagnosed, the doors to managing the system will be a lot easier to open.   I think that's all for now."
"I have high functioning autism as well as anxiety so some of this may be the anxiety but I find it really hard maintaining friendships at all for example I left 1.5 years ago  and haven't spoken to one of them in over a year because I quite honestly didn't know how.  I also find communicating really hard. It takes a lot of effort and I would find meeting someone new really hard with me having no Idea where to go past hello and me getting a stutter is also quite likely.  I don't cope well with changes from a routine, for example I will eat the same meals each day and foods but going off of it is really quite stressful  I am also really bad with emotions and I rarely talk about them at all (and wont unless im prompted explicitly) and am really oblivious on the whole and really cant explain it, a bit like trying to explain what left is to someone with no place to reference   A bit of another side effect is at the moment I have no scoial life as I don't know how to keep one (the last one I had was at school and I wouldn't describe it as close owning to the fact I never saw them outside of school) nor get one  as I don't know how to meet people.  What comes naturally to most people takes a lot of learing for me  and I always felt a step behind if not further.  At the moment at least, I would love to be just a normal person and have this sort of stuff come naturally  All in all I would say a bit lonely and frustrating when I notice, I am quite happy most of the time but just the smallest thing can hit and change that. I am doing what I can to get better but ti takes a lot of effort for what is for most people as simple as writing  EDIT: I would like to thank everyone's kind words, advice and offers to talk, I will try and answer all your questions. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You are all fantastic and this is really moving.  EDIT 2: I am amazed at the outpouring of sympathy, offers to be friends and advice. Thank you so so much  EDIT 3: do not use me to diagnose you, go to an expert to do that as they both are more likely to get it right and can also do more to help"
"As an autistic person, what's being not autistic like?"
"While I live a pretty normal life I have a lot of issues with sensory sensitivity. Like loud noises, bright lights, certain food tastes, smells and standing in crowds of people. These things make me feel a bit stressed out resulting in various issues like headaches and digestive problems.   While we're on the subject. Certain non-autistic people have the misconception that those of us on the spectrum would ""lack empathy"". That is simply *not* true. We often have a hard time to ""read"" people, but we certainly do not lack human empathy. That needed to be said. "
"Well I would first like to note that it's different for everyone. I learned to have a pretty normal life with some adaptations. I had to learn to look people in the eyes when I talk to them, didn't come naturally to me. I still don't like it when I feel uncomfortable. Now I can understand non-verbal communication pretty well but once in a while there is that one person I just can't read. Is this your form of sarcasm, are you angry? Pure pokerface for me.  Emotions can be more extreme, especially the negative ones unfortunately. There is a sudden trigger and a switch just flips. I usually take a step back and take a breather to get myself to baseline then.  This also ties in with control for me. I have a hard time with unfamiliar situations/places or if I have no way out. What's normal there, how should I behave, what if I do something wrong? What if I need a moment to myself where do I go? I would love to travel but everything about it can get me into a panic. But once I'm there and have assigned a spot as my place to collect myself I'm fine. Getting there is the hard part.  I also want to be really really sure someone likes a present. I am horrible at giving a gift without them knowing what it is. I only not check if they would like it if there is no doubt in my mind that they would love it.  Last thing I can come up with is sensory filters. Filtering useless info is exhausting, and I feel lucky I can even do that even though it costs me extra energy. A club is a nightmare, way too loud and too many people and lights. On the flip side when it's super quiet my mind focuses on the background hum, equally distracting. That's why I usually put on something from [here](https://mynoise.net/) , I love that I can customize every soundscape. Still day to day live is just a lot of info input and I need some time alone so my mind can process it all and dump the useless garbage. I'm fine as long as I don't go to intentionally overstimulating places and make sure I get enough rest."
"My go to analogy is to imagine being in a country where nobody speaks English and you don't speak their language. You don't have a phrasebook but you do have a translation dictionary. So you are speaking the words but the syntax is way off, not to mention accent and pronunciation. You might think you're making sense and communicating well but really people will be confused by you.  EDIT: So, this got me a lot of attention. Thank you for all the feedback and I'm happy to see that some people found my comment helpful. To clarify, I am talking from experience as someone with Aspergers Syndrome. Those elsewhere on the spectrum will of course have different feelings.  EDIT 2 - The Sequel: Wow, my first Gold! Thank you!  EDIT 3-D : In 20 minutes 3 people have asked this same thing so I'll explain: Yes, I may come across fine in writing. But I can take my time here, there is no pressure on me to respond quickly or at all and I don't have you staring at me. I also know when to stop typing. "
"For me, it's being different enough to be noticed and alienated from other people, but being similar enough to know it and hate yourself for it. I'm high functioning, but I was always a little bit less developed than others my age and was always ostracized for it. Got bullied out of highschool by former friends when I finally told them I was high functioning and haven't ever finished. Now after isolating myself for 7 years I have no idea how to make friends because social interaction is something that does not come naturally or easily to many of us. You can try and try to make friends but there is always the little voice reminding you that you are different and you are always paranoid that others notice. So you begin to hate yourself for it which then is noticed by others who then don't want to be around you, further convincing you of your differentness. It is the most lonely feeling in the world to know how you are supposed to act and not be able to do so, as hard as you try. I would not wish it on anyone. "
"It's really, really lonely. To be desperate to go out and be with people but at the same time have no idea how to interact with them. Left out of every conversation. Completely ignored.  The benefits are basically being able to concentrate on anything and really excel at it. Also not falling apart in an emergency, because the emotions of the situation don't really come into play."
"Imagine you just started a new job, but you didn't get any on the job training, the company has a very different work ethic to what you're used to, the environment is different, the people are unapproachable, everyone seems to know what they're doing but you, nobody seems to accept that you don't know what you're doing, they just get irritated with you, it's assumed that you can just ask people for help if you're struggling but everyone is scary to approach and makes you feel inadequate. That's what it's like for me anyway  EDIT: An extension to this metaphor, also imagine that everyone else loves their job but you're only doing it because there are no other jobs going and you need the money, ideally you'd be doing something else but it's not an option, this is the job you have, like it or not"
"One of the things that bothers me most is that I have a very hard time expressing myself verbally. I am supposed to be high functioning and am overall pretty bright. But when it's time to speak, I sound like a dumbass.   Whenever I want to talk about something complex, I find myself struggling, it's like somebody else is speaking in my place sometimes.  This can be quite frustrating. Imagine that you are an experienced stamp collector, and when somebody asks you about some of the interesting aspect of your hobby, you can't get past: 'I find stamps pretty'. (whilst being fully aware how retarded that sounded)  This is obviously an exaggeration, but that's pretty much how I feel sometimes.  edit: also fuck making excessive eye contact ;)."
"For me, horrible. I am lonely. I want to be around people so much. I love talking, they taught me to talk and forgot to give me others to talk to. I want to work, but I need supervision.       I hit my head on things when I am upset. I hate that. My arms flap when I am excited and people stare. People stare for other reasons too...       And I love children and children love me, they love to talk to me and ask questions, or talk to me about cartoons. I would never harm anyone but their parents act like their child is in danger it makes me feel like I am a terrible person.       Luckily now I am friends with an 8 year old and she is awesome, loves lego and we have a lot of talks about who is the best disney princess. Explorers (I told her about an explorer in lego Johnny Thunder who explored tombs and she has suddenly decided to love the idea) and also about doctor who and time travel (The back seat of her car is a time machine when we go anywhere!)    So I guess in short, Autism is lonely, it can cause a lot of pain, its like being trapped in a body that is only half loaded. Just cause people are aware of autism or accept autism, doesn't mean they will make time for those with autism.   Also I wish I  could dress and shower myself and care for myself better and also go out on my own. I would go out every day. :)  Friends make it easier.    My thoughts may have been bit broken so hope this reads okay.  Also suggest reading this. http://www.mattyangel.com/2013/04/13/autism-and-me-part-1/ though only 5 parts.  Edit: Was asked about sensory. Yes, things can be hard. I need help to get dressed. Often I put a pillow over my eyes so that I can shut out some of what my brain is seeing so that I can process any touch. I hate noises they make me hurt and scared. I often don't hear what people say because I have some auditory processing problems when other things are going on. I find certain touches hard. I have lots of toys I use to stay calmer. Like ribbons from my bag. A toy turtle that is bright and full of sand so its weighted. :)  Edit: People have asked to see my cat, This is her. https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5qs3z3/people_have_asked_to_see_my_therapy_cat_princess/"
"It's hard, not only socially but also in school. I can't understand what the questions are asking me because I always interpret it in another way. Expecially the questions like ""Why did the author write this, how does the author feel?.. etc."" I would always question if I was reading this answer correctly, and my teachers would get frustrated with me due to the excessive amount of questions I asked.   Socially I've managed to cope with my autism, I was quiet in middleschool and a little bit of highschool. I figured out I'm best at making myself look ridiculous infront of people. I now just laugh at myself and I seem to fit in, however most of the time I don't really catch on to my friend's jokes or opinions.    **Edit**: Yes this is a throwaway, I don't like talking about it on the internet because people like google searching usernames now-a-days and use any information they find against you. :\ Last thing I need is to be bullied for being autistic, on the internet, it's already enough to deal with in real life."
"It's perfectly fine until it's not. Sometimes a situation I've been through a hundred times before will suddenly be sensory overload, can't think, panic and anxiety set in.   Thankfully I have a very understanding partner who can help me through it. But sometimes that's too much for me too. Those are the worst days :/  "
"I am a female high functioning autistic with general anxiety and social anxiety. I'm not sure exactly where the anxiety ends and the autism begins. The two issues are a recipe for loneliness.   The majority of the time most people do not notice my autism. I'm pretty good at faking it. I dropped out of school but I'm not sure if it's because my anxiety made me unable to cope with my autism or my autism made me unable to cope with my anxiety. Anxiety is not logical, it makes no sense and it's stupid and suffocating. After wasting years of my life buried in online gaming, I got a job. In retail. I learned to feign interest, make and hold eye contact and not completely lose my shit when someone touches me or stands too close to me. I even got to a state where I was able to talk on the phone. That is where the tables turned for me, as long as my anxiety was under control, I could blend in with the NT crowd.  When people push me past my emotional or physical comfort level I start to revert back and the autism comes seeping out. I twitch, my leg will bounce, I can't look at people, and if I keep being pushed I usually end up banging my head on things and trying to get away from the situation by hiding somewhere quiet, cramped and dark.  I don't relate to peoples pain. I don't feel sympathy for anyone except my son, and even then it's only for some things. I don't feel badly when horrible things happen to people, like car accidents and cancer. I (think) I am really good at looking sad, and I'll put my hand on your shoulder and tell you 'I am here for you', and I will listen to you, but I don't really care. I just do what I think is expected of me.  I get very agitated when plans change. I like to know exactly what is happening, where we are going, how we will get there, who will be there, what will be provided to eat and drink, and if any of those things is not as I expected it's like someone has derailed my entire day and I find it hard to find an alternative or interact with a person I didn't expect to be there because I didn't have my 'small talk' planned out already.  Certain sounds make me want to vomit out my insides and makes it feel like my ears are bleeding. I can't stand touching cotton balls or velour and velvet fabric. I can't sleep without a blanket on me, even on 30°C+ nights, I think I need to invest in a weighted blanket.  My hobbies often vary wildly, but they can last a long time and be very intense. In 5 years I went from owning a Betta splenden in a 10 litre tank to a 550 litre full reef system with several thousand dollars worth of equipment and another 20+ fish tanks scattered throughout the house. I dumped all that and now I'm sewing, I have enough fabric to be buried alive underneath and not be found until the smell of my rotting corpse drew the neighbours attention. I've only had that hobby for 2 years. I've progessed a significant amount since I had a child 2 years ago, though it took me a suicide attempt and a lot of help to get through the first year. It has changed who I am as a person and how I relate to other people a lot. It helped me to lose the strict, structured routine that I had to have, and replaced it with a much more relaxed one, and I finally understand love."
"I'm on the spectrum but I don't experience a lot of the 'classic' symptoms like flapping and having meltdowns or not being able to cope in crowds etc. Apparently that's common in girls with autism/aspergers and a lot of us don't actually get diagnosed until much later in life. Something to do with girls supposedly being able to 'hide' it better and fit in.     I struggle a lot with social interaction, I used to be very awkward when I was younger and I would just say embarrassing cringey stuff and I was bullied a lot for it. Now I just stay quiet and I struggle to make conversation with new people, the flow of conversation just doesn't come naturally. When I do talk, I can't speak in the right tone and people usually think I'm just rude. I have to really force myself to appear friendly, but it just feels wrong and just makes me more anxious.   Some autistic people also have major problems with executive function, but I feel like it isn't really spoken about. Doctors/therapists never mentioned it and I went a long time just thinking I was just lazy. The stereotype of autism really pushes this idea that we are incredibly good at things like maths or a certain subject. I can't do maths at all, it just doesn't work with my mind beyond the basics (even then I usually rely on a calculator.) I was very interested in creative writing growing up, and I still am, but I struggle to actually piece ideas together and motivate myself to write them. This carries onto everyday tasks like being able to figure out what needs doing to make a meal, pick out an outfit, clean my apartment etc. Organising myself is a huge problem. Everything seems more complicated than it is and I have to break things down into individual tasks or it just seems overwhelming.   I have 'special interests' too. Namely sci-fi, I love Star Wars and just about everything Star Wars is incredibly interesting to me. I also have phases of special interest that kind of come and go (another reason I feel like I could also be bipolar as these phases are much like mania). A few months ago I was obsessed with the idea of collecting dolls and dollhouses, more recently I've been researching Wicca. Now I'm not interested in either.   I'd describe it like my brain is totally manual. Things don't come naturally to me and I have to make notes all the time to keep on track of things otherwise I just forget. At the moment I keep a bullet journal which helps quite a bit. It's like I have to manage my thoughts externally or everything is just a huge mess. I have to prepare myself a lot for social interaction and I can spend an entire day planning what I'm going to say or what topics I plan to talk about with somebody to avoid being too awkward. I have a lot of symptoms which also match up to ADHD and bipolar disorder though so I'm still trying to work that out. Unfortunately so far the mental health professionals I've tried to speak to about it just brush it off as being part of autism so I don't really know for sure. My experiences don't really fit the idea of autism that I grew up being told about, so my own mental health is very confusing to me.   "
"High functioning, with the depression, anxiety and mild dyslexia that goes with it. I can get unexpectedly and disproportionately agitated and frustrated when plans get changed or something is cancelled. Even something small like having my mind set on what I'm having for dinner and then being offered something else. I know logistically that it doesn't matter that we're not having pizza like we planned but it can make me extremely agitated and temperamental. Which, of course, makes me more anxious.   I have found myself in conflict with people at work when a joke was taken the wrong way or I straight up misunderstood their intention, and had to work hard to remedy things or know when to drop things. I can easily escalate problems because someone else's point of view seems so illogical. Many people I work with know I have these conditions, but not all. I try to be held to the same expectations as my co-workers and if I fuck up due to my condition I'll take the penalty.   I'm lucky to have an understanding wife and friends both in and out of work. They know if I'm agitated I need time to myself, or may need to stick to a routine even if it seems unimportant or petty. I've had some great managers at work who have put in the time to coach me through a communication issue if I say I'm not sure how to handle it.   The sensory perception is annoying. I wear sunglasses everywhere and so many people ask why I'm always wearing them, tell me ""it's not that bright"". If we're at a pub or club or anything with a lot of chatter I might as well be wearing sound proof headphones for all I can distinguish.   On the other hand my obsessive interest in film makes me super knowledgeable for my current profession. It's not uncommon for people to ask how I know so much about movies, comics, TV and whatnot. I seek out and retain a LOT of information when I'm into a topic. As my (also autistic) son calls it, we 'suck it into our brain' for later.   It's not much fun seeing how the term autistic gets thrown around on Reddit these days, it's become an all encompassing insult for anyone who appears anti-social, dumb or in disagreement with the larger population. Not much can be done about that though. "
"I'm very high-functioning (when I went for my diagnosis sessions in the end they said I was level 1) but even then there's so many things I find so very hard.  Much like a lot of other people here have said, I just have such a tough time socially. I don't know how to keep a conversation as certain words or phrases make me feel uncomfortable. I don't like asking people how they're going or any sort of questions and I wish I could tell you why. It just hurts to say some things.  I also just want to talk only about very certain things. I have maybe 1 or 2 subjects I'm well or decently versed in. Anything outside of that and you can't talk to me about it because it is unforseen and I can't prepare myself for it.   I *need* to know exactly what to do when I'm entering in a social situation. I need to know when to say hello, what to say after, how to proceed from there, and how to finish it up. But the nature of conversation does not allow that 90% of the time.  I've spent years and years learning how to interact with cashiers because I need to know when to say what I'm buying, when I should pay, what I should wait for before taking my item and leaving, and everything like that.  Everything must be structured or else you get an incredibly awkward conversation.   But what I hate the most is that I'm this close to being normal. I'm high-functioning. I can speak, I don't get angry for little reason, I don't get perturbed at loud noises or off lights or any sort of nuance.  On the surface and in my mind I'm normal. But I just crumble when I need to talk to people.  I can't do it, my mind refuses to do it. I clam up, I forget everything, I speak quietly and directly. I show no gaps for anybody to finesse a conversation out of me. It's yes or no answers unless you get me talking about my favourite subjects.  It gets so lonely. I can't deviate outside of my small friends circle I cultivated from when I was younger. I maintain that and try very hard to make new friends but it just doesn't work.  Anxiety hits me hard because of it. I'm so scared of people now it's ridiculous. The fact I can recognise what's wrong and how to properly act when I'm alone, only to lose all integrity when I'm actually forced to converse with people is just so frustrating.   I go to parties with my friends and I get drunk because that's the only way I feel normal again. I talk to people and I'm to drunk to fail. Everything I say is hilarious and people like me.  Then I sober up and it's depressing again. Nobody is clamouring to talk to me anymore because I hide myself away until it's time to drink again.  It's such an immense struggle and I can't articulate *why.* I feel like an idiot all the time. I'm constantly forgetting things, and fumble over my words. I can't look at people in the eyes when they talk to me and I just can't stand being around people anymore. I feel so alone even when I'm in a crowd of people.   I wish I could just blurt out ""I'm autistic so I'm gunna be awkward but stick with me"" every time I met someone so they'd at least know. Nobody gives me the time of day because I'm so hard to talk to and knowing how much effort it will take just for me to act normal kills me man. I just want to be like everyone else. "
"Unusualsoup, you have just made me a really happy lady. ( I just created an account to respond to you, I read threads and have never felt the need to respond) I am a 25 year old nanny to an autistic 5 year old, I can read him faster than anyone else can. I've learnt to adapt to his needs, and with therapy and a specialist and lots of coaching, he is a very verbal child now. The stares and rude comments from strangers are very upsetting. But thankfully he is oblivious to them for now.  He loves routine, and used to be very obsessive about every little thing in his daily life. He has really come out of his shell in the last two years. But he is very selective of who can be around him.   It is so nice and refreshing to see such a nice person on the internet and know that my cute little 5 year old has the chance to one day be comfortable to talk to strangers. Thank you SO much for giving me a little hope on a rough day. All the best to you!  "
"My brother is autistic. I can't tell you what it's like from his perspective, but it doesn't take long to figure out that a lot of people have zero sympathy for someone that isn't neurotypical."
"I'm high functioning, and from what I can see I'm really lucky compared to some others...  I do have the habit of being rather... extravagant. I look back at some of the things that little Lord Charco did and want to garrote him (only slightly exaggerating, in all honesty). When I have things that I like or am even slightly interested in, I'm into them in a major way. Normally, we're talking video games.  When I was in my Portal 2 phase, I wrote a short story about it in class. That same year, I was also in my Skyward Sword phase. We were asked to choose an artist and research them. I chose Yoshiyuki Oyama, the main artist behind the art style in that game. This obsession type of thing can be found in other areas, which makes being a teenager way harder than it needs to be.  Sentimentality is a good way of describing this. Right now, I'm in a holiday house that my family frequented for a few years. One of the things I did when I was here was that after dinner, I would go down to a corner store not too far away. That became a really special thing about coming here. We went out for dinner, and when we came back, we noticed it was closed. I was genuinely upset.   I know this makes me sound like a spoiled little shit, but walking down to that store while the sun was going down, and walking home while being able to hear and see the beach made me so happy. Having the ice cream kind of gave things a ""through line"". Typing this out now, it sounds weird, silly, and really stupid and petty, but this is kind of what it's like. You have these really strong feelings that you know are wrong, but you can't not have anyway. Maybe that's the hormones. Maybe it's both. It's weird though, I know that. It feels like emotional purgatory.   Onto the good things, though. I'm way luckier than others. I don't attack myself or others during emotional breakdowns. I don't tear things down like I've seen can happen. I have impulses to do so, yes, but during those moments I know I'll regret any damage I cause. Which makes times when dad gives me a hammer and asks me to dislodge a piece of wood all the more sweet.  Wow, this turned out way longer than I thought. I do hope this gives people a different idea than what the common myths and views seem to be. "
This is one of the best threads I've ever seen on Reddit.

"High functioning, so maybe I'm not getting the ""full"" experience. Typed out in stream of consciousness so sorry if it doesn't flow.  Eye contact is tricky. It's not so much that I hate it or it's uncomfortable, I just never think to use it. But also when I look people in the eye it feels oddly...confrontational? Never quite understood eye contact.  If I'm highly stressed, I shut down. I'll seek out a corner and stare at the floor. I've gotten better about speaking up and letting people know.  When I was little I had no idea how annoying I was. Every question the teacher asked I was flailing my arms begging to be called. I would get in trouble for playing too rough at recess. Whenever the counsellor would talk to me I'd burst into tears.  I'm pretty bad at small talk. Even if someone just asks ""What's up?"" I try to think of something witty instead of ""not much"" and an awkward moment will pass. I'm not great at talk in general either, or in sounding confident about what I say, not because I'm not confident in the words but I'm just not confident in saying them aloud.  Nowadays I try to study people to get an idea of what I should be doing to fit in properly. I'm definitely an odd mix of logical and emotional.  Also, cuddles and hugs are crack to me. Which I know that autistic people are extra big on touch.  Sometimes I'll ""stim"" (flail my arms) if I'm excited or hyping myself up or trying to stay awake but only when I'm alone.  Feel free to ask me to expand on anything!"
"It's different for everyone. I have Aspergers Syndrome, a more mild form of Autism that affects me more socially than anything. I live a normal life in that I work full time, I go to university too. I don't need/want care or supervision. Here are the ways which it affects my life:   1. I have my interests and obsessions - I get intensely interested in something for a period of time. Mine tend to go for about a year - in the past it's been burlesque, pin-up girls, medieval history, motorcycles etc. I don't really collect things, just learn as much about it as I possibly can and spend a huge chunk of time doing so.   2. I struggle with sarcasm and innuendo, and I don't make facial expressions that match my emotions - I've been told before while apologising that I don't look sorry, but I have literally no idea what a sorry look is. However, my friends (all 3 of them) get me and know that I'm an awful liar anyway so they don't need to worry about my sincerity.   3. I'm also affectionate at all, my friends know not to be all huggy and kissy as it makes me super uncomfortable. I like my personal space, and am very defensive about it.   4. I can go into sensory overload, but it has to be specific circumstances for it to happen - shopping malls tend to be the perfect storm of ""triggers"". Loud noises, bright lights, people bumping into me, easy to get lost etc etc.   5. I have a very high IQ. I'm aware that doesn't make me 'smart' per se, but it's a thing. My psychologist had me tested when I was 19, it came out at 143. I process information very quickly, and I acquire new information and retain it easily.   6. I'm very logical - I don't get lost in fantasy land. Even with what I read and films I watch, if I can't believe it I can't enjoy it. So I don't enjoy LOTR, Harry Potter etc and people act like I killed their dog when I inform them of this.   7. I had to learn to have a filter on what I say - and sometimes I slip up. When I was a kid, I used to say all kinds of inappropriate shit to adults, and as I was undiagnosed until 18 people just thought I was ill-mannered. My psychologist has helped me heaps, and my mum has been great ever since I received a diagnosis...and she apologised for all the ass kickings as a kid (haha).   8. Not so much any more, but I used to fidget. Specifically, I used to spin things in circles. Just whatever I was holding. I never got an explanation as to why I did this, I just got told it's common in Autistic kids.   I would like to say that life is far better for me now than it was as a child, school was literally the worst. In school people pick on anyone that's different, and Australia seems to have this huge anti-intellectualism culture: I was bullied horribly for my preference of books over people, however I was suddenly very useful when it came to trivia, or assignments, or anything that required thinking. If you have any questions about my experience, please ask away. I'm very open about it and if you want to learn I'll gladly be of assistance :)   EDIT: Guys, I love all the messages I've received that I've read thus far. If you feel as though my 'list' describes you and you have suspicions that you may sit on the Autism spectrum, please see a professional. My experiences may not match yours; and I am not a mental health professional and will not be handing out diagnoses. I sincerely wish you all the best of luck though :) "
"It's hard to articulate; I can't really note every difference from allism because I know nothing but autism as my baseline.  I know I have a peculiar experience of motion. My internal map of this body differs from the external, & I frequently move in ways that feel graceful but look odd. I particularly enjoy mimicking motions, such as reloading a revolver. I won't sit down; I'll stand & pace & do that, or perch on something, because it feels good. I feel other people lack this joy in motion,  My hearing is sensitive, but also unclear: there's a fine line between unintelligibly quiet & painfully loud. There are sounds in public that hurt worse than getting a new scar, & I have an instinctive terror of loud machine sounds. Washing machines, cars, etc. I wear headphones almost 12 hours a day; I love music.  In social situations, I struggle to read people. Eye contact feels like plugging my pupil into a live electric outlet. I've been called charming; I don't find it complicated to imitate the manner of a charming person, & evidently understanding how it works isn't required. Since people expect me to have ""appropriate"" body language, I'm generally not a bad mimic of other things. My natural body language includes bird-screams of joy (""wrrAAAAK!""), the classic hand flapping, odd contortions & spasms, & eyelid flickering. I have permanent visual ""static"" from frequently crushing my eyes under my knees as a child; I stopped.  I frequently self-injure, which I regard as normal and healthy for me. Allistic people's squeamishness about it doesn't particularly sway me. I tend to smile involuntarily when people are crying or angry, (not because I like this), so I'll repress that with a quiet nail-scratch. I've been known to control rage by thumbnailing strips down my neck, bang my head into walls with distress, etc. One time, I expressed profound grief with injury. Not because I lost control of myself, but because I felt extreme injury demonstrated the depth of my feeling in a concrete manner. This was important to me. I'm not sure I relate to pain the way other people do.  I went a surprisingly long time without a diagnosis. Perhaps that's part of why I like being autistic; it helped save me from thinking of myself as a broken-brained fuckup. There are things I pursue perfection in single-mindedly, unusual perspectives I access. I see a lot of good in being exactly like I am.  Edit; Oh, and I lack affective empathy. That's a significant difference. I had it very strongly as a child: I'd cry over suffering people I was told about. I don't feel anything like that anymore. It's less morally corrosive than you think; I still want to feel like a good person, even if my brain doesn't whack me with the sympathy stick anymore."
"I'm an Aspie, and for me, I feel like for my social stuff, think my social program is running Windows 2000, and everyone is running Windows 10. You can mostly get what is happening around you, but not well. Some days it is fine (I know a lot of ASD people, about half to 3/4 of the people I know) but when my brain slows down, I really notice the lack of understanding.  I love to read, I love to play games (Minecraft is a fave, as I can terraform and make things nice), and love to watch movies. As I have anxiety and flareups of depression, these can also be ways to help me cope (or they stop being fun too, and thats a bugger).  There is many a thing that affects me, all senses can be affected at times. My baseline for normal is not quite the same, my brothers are ASD too.  I hate doing things that take a lot of effort. I would likely be seen as lazy, but my motivation is very low except in rare periods of frenzy, where ""ALL THE THINGS MUST BE DONE"" usually at 4am when I cant due to noise. I often will think and overthink a whole conversation that will never be said anyway.  Since I have become an adult, the structure that kept me relatively coping has fallen away, and I find myself unable to create structure for myself, and barely okay for my daughter (who is also ASD, though not yet diagnosed). Ironic when your child is given better stucture in life by the person who cant do it for themself.  All in all, I know Im okay, but feel like a failure for not achieving what I know I could do if only I functioned fulltime."
"I'm an 18 year old female with Asperger's and considering it's much more common for guys to have it, no one ever really think you do have it.   High functioning autism is (from my own personal experience, i'm no doctor) much harder to notice in girls because they are able to copy surrounding behavior and social norms and technically act their way to what is expected of them.  I was diagnosed along with my older brother at the age of 7 after extreme anxiety and anger issues. I am in no way a genies, and neither is my brother. WE missed out on that.   I do get really obsessed with things which i have heard is a common trait of aspies. I've been obsessed with tv characters and shows (to the point of me reading back stories and wikis on everything), jigsaw puzzles, terrorism in the middle east, dolphin hunting in japan, Dr Phil etc.   I've only told one of my friends about me, but she knew me well enough to assume anyway. I can usually pass for nobody noticing. The only really noticeable things about me is my struggle to maintain eye contact, extreme awkwardness in large groups of adults or friends (christmas, parties) and my anxiety, which is practically gone because of most of my life being on antidepressants.   I sometimes struggle to be sad if that makes sense. I do have empathy and i can notice when other people are sad or if a sad thing has happen but sometimes i don't feel sad. Like i just don't really care. Same for cute things sometimes. Like, i have no care for babies. I think they're ugly.   I've struggled to come to terms with my asperger's, especially since i have had to come to accept that it defines a lot of who i will be for the rest of my life. Sometimes i remember that people don't find some things so hard, or they get bored with me talking about Robespierre for as long as possible. I forget that i'm different. And sometimes that fucking sucks. Sometimes it feels like everyone has the same brain and it all makes sense in there and its the same for everyone and their brain. And i've been told that the way i think and observe is different from everyone else's. But it doesn't feel like i'm different. I feel completely normal. And that is the hardest part about Asperger's for me . I don't look like i should have it. If you look at the stereotypes of people with autism (high-functioning or not) it's not a average graded 18 year old girl who loves make-up, parties and traveling the world. I hate maths and science. I'm terrible at both. I don't have an eidetic memory or remember pi. So yeah, it can be annoying that all aspies characters in media (not like there is many) are young guys, extremely socially awkward and everyone is a genius.   Regardless, i'm proud of who i am and all that i have accomplished in my short life so far."
I have a really hard time accepting things that I don't like if no one can give me a reasonable reason as to why that thing is happening.
"I made a reddit account just for this. Autism for me is like: being dismissed, being praised for still existing, being confused, sometimes not being able to speak, sometimes not understanding others when they speak for like 5 minutes after they speak. Doing stuff in different positions from others, awkward gait, did I mention the confusion, lots of comorbid mental illnesses, nobody being interested in anything I like most of the time... fine motor control issues. Chronic pain (probably fibro, this is almost always a thing.). Underestimating my intelligence, overestimating my intelligence. Underestimating and overestimating how much my autism disables me. Not understanding why one can't correct me when one says I have autism and I say I ""am autistic"". Being trans is even more weird. ""Yeah, I'm autistic and suck at math, it's called dyscalculia and is a common learning disability that can co-occur with autism."" Yeah, I know, that Ph.D psychologist who diagnosed me? Totally full of shit. I really need a better evaluation. Thanks for that. Most importantly, the best part of being autistic is that everyone but you knows best. Why bother trying to have any kind of agency when everyone is clearly trying to make decisions for you?"
"I'm not autistic but my partner of the last 4 years is, and I'd like to answer this question by describing what she's told me and how we address these things in our incredibly close and intimate life together.  1. She is autism level 2. I'm not sure of the technical terminology, but since austism's reclassification as ASD there are apparently 3 levels of severity. She is at the middle level. There are senses in which she is high-functioning, but there are other senses in which she is low-functioning, so it's a mixed bag.  2. One thing I've learned from being so close to her is that intelligence as traditionally classified doesn't really make a lot of sense. She was invited to MENSA when she was young, she can read a complicated 10-page scientific article in like literally 5 minutes, and although I've been playing chess for about 20 years and she hasn't played since she was 7 or 8 and never played seriously, she beat me the one time we played and I can tell her chess intuition is on a bizarrely advanced level. However, she also is often incapable of using language to express herself, especially in person, which can make her seem ""dumb"". I've also learned that the stereotype about autistic people being really ""smart"" is just inaccurate, as the majority of autistic people are actually mentally impaired. My partner is the exception, not the rule.  3. She has three special interests. If you don't know, a special interest is a topic which an autistic person is uniquely obsessed with. They are usually lifelong or at least last for a very long time, and the degree to which an autistic person is invested in their special interest usually greatly surpasses the degree to which any neurotypical person might be invested in one of their interests. She always jokes that ""The wand chooses you"", meaning when you're autistic you don't get to choose your special interest, and some people get lucky with something which helps their career or is more socially acceptable, whereas many autistic people (like her) get something which is a little bizarre and doesn't help her pursue a career at all. She describes having a special interest as being simultaneously the best thing and the worst thing. Best because she can get immense pleasure out of engaging with her special interest, worst because when she's trying to do other things that don't involve her special interest, often she feels intense compulsions and has invasive thoughts which pertain to her special interest and make it impossible for her to continue doing what she's doing.  4. She has huge issues with certain textures, sounds, and visuals. She can't go to the grocery store regularly with me (she definitely can't ever go alone), as when she does she is often fully expended by the time we get home and incapable of doing anything else or talking for a few hours. She has a hard time dealing with certain kinds of foods because the textures are unpalatable to her. However, she also gets immense pleasure out of ""stimming"", which if you don't know is when an autistic person or other person who likes to stim has some sensation they really like (usually tactile) and they play by repeatedly experiencing that sensation. My girlfriend really likes to play with touch-heavy toys like kinetic sand and slime with little balls inside. Personally, I encourage her to stim and often buy toys for her because it makes me happy when she has something which brings her so much joy. However, a lot of things like hand-flapping that autistic people do to stim are considered socially unacceptable, even though if I had it my way she'd be able to flap her hands anytime she's excited (I think it's cute and don't give two shits how she expresses herself when she's excited) and anyone who doesn't like it can catch these hands.  5. She's an easy target for bullying, abuse, exploitation, etc. She's aware of this and has a good sense of humor about it, but she is very very trusting, and doesn't have an easy time perceiving manipulation. She also has a hard time being independent from others, so she has been taken advantage of and hurt many times. Knowing this, it's always been a huge fear of mine that I'll take advantage of her myself, but we have a very good amount of trust built up in our relationship and we seem to do a good job of staying on an equal playing field through lots of communication despite the fact that she inherently struggles with a lot of things which come natural to me.  6. She can't speak sometimes at all, and even when she can speak her sentences are often short and somewhat confusing. It can be hard to tell what she means. She interprets everything very literally, which takes some getting used to. But it can also be pretty funny. One time I told her to clear everything off the table and throw it out because we were cleaning our apartment and there was a ton of garbage on the table, and she proceeded to start to throw out literally everything on the table including one ceramic bowl and the remote. Why? Because that's what I said. We got a good laugh out of that one. I think that's another key thing: you need to have a lot of patience for each other because you both will misunderstand each other a lot, and it's good to have a sense of humor when there is a communication mishap.  There's more but those are some of the more important things to cover. She's a great person and I'm very happy and lucky to be with her. I guess the last thing I wanted to say is that lately casual ableism towards autistic people has become really trendy and it really upsets me. People now use ""autistic"" as an insult. It's really offensive when you spend every day of your life loving someone who is autistic to see the whole thing be trivialized and mocked by people who have no sympathy for it. My partner finds it disrespectful too."
"At the age of 4 I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. At 6 it was rediagnosed with a form of autism new at that time. Asperger's (ASD now). I spent most days of school attending very short therapy sessions that were to help with my social issues. The problem is that it just puts on a mask for you. You're never very comfortable, and you couldn't care less about other people anyhow. The worse part is the apathy I dealt with until Highschool. It's surprising that I was even able to keep friends. Weirdly enough my apathy gradually disappeared in my teen years and I was able to socialize witg other people. Most people can't even tell I have a disorder anymore. Nowadays I'm a very active member of 2 vocal performance groups at my college (this actually cured some of social awkwardness) and have a small group of friends that I communicate with frequently. My advice: get therapy. If it doesn't make sense at first, just keep doing it. I would not be able to handle social situations now without it. My friends mean a lot to me and honestly I don't think i'd have them if I didn't do it.   Another thing is yes I had hardcore hearing sensory issues that caused me to freak out but I am quite cured of that. "
"I'm a woman with Asperger's. As a rule, autism is really different in women from how it is in men.   I am a really happy person and I have everything I need in life. On paper I look really normal: I have a job, I'm married, I have normal intelligence.   I'm just strange. I don't know how to have friends, I don't quite know how to speak to strangers normally. Just about every conversation I have outside of my home is scripted, with my lines cobbled together from things I've heard other people say that sounded 'normal.'  I once had a boyfriend who called me a robot, because my emotions and speech seemed artificial. It hurt me a lot then, but I decided to 'own it' and so that's where my username came from. "
"Jesus wept this is a long one...  I always thought I was an average, if quiet kid. I had some friends, used to play outside with them, I was a little odd but what kid doesn't have their quirks? I loved climbing trees, looking at frogs and other animals, racing bikes on the street.   School was hell, and I couldn't understand why I was singled out. I have deformities but they weren't super obvious like a hunched back or whatever, just deformed thumbs and odd feet. Still got beaten up though. Now you're probably thinking that this is boys beating up a boy right? No. I'm female. They were a gang of boys (at least 6) beating up one girl and they lived on the same street, so although I still mainly liked my childhood it was pretty rough. But again. I thought I was average, if a little nerdy and odd.  One day my dad took me to the doctor. I thought it was a standard check up and all seemed like it was. She was asking my dad a lot of questions about me, mainly about my problem with making new friends and being very reserved. I didn't think much of it, until I was taken to a child psychologist and was given these strange exams and tasks with bricks and word association. Again, I thought it was odd but oddly kind of liked it. I felt like I was actually being challenged in a way school never did. However, they asked about the bullying and how I coped with it and when I told them how I handled being beaten up I noticed the psychologist's face became concerned. You see, when I was physically beaten I had learned how to essentially numb myself to it. Because I knew that if I fought back not only would I lose (always did) I'd also get in trouble with the school for being in a fight even if I was the victim. I just zoned out, let them do whatever (kicking, punching, stomping, spitting, sometimes hair pulling...again, 6 boys against one girl.) and once they were done I just hid in a corner for a bit to gather myself.  A few months pass from the tests and I find myself in the classroom with a note taker at my side. She's friendly enough but she seemed to shadow me all the time and didn't really help too much when I was bullied. Like, she was only there in the classes but went to the staff room during breaks. I asked my dad why this woman was there and he explained that I had a disability. He explained I had Asperger's Syndrome and what that meant.   It was like someone had given me the lost puzzle piece to why people called me weird or spastic. I wasn't JUST nerdy and quiet, I couldn't handle loud places because I'm sensitive to crowded loud places. I can't make new friends because my anxiety kicks in and keeps telling me I'm going to fuck up the conversation I want to have with this new person. It also explained my odd fixations on things. Like I used to find chickens really funny (they still are funny but less so because people always used to give me chicken themed gifts for like 5 years. It got annoying REAL fast.)  I do feel emotions, but with Autism it's like someone amped those emotions to full blast. When I feel angry it's like I'm on fire. I shake a little, I want to scream, I want to yell, but I know I shouldn't. So, I excuse myself, go to a secluded spot and calm myself down (while swearing like a sailor) When I'm stressed or anxious I always cry and no matter what I do to stop it it always comes out. I feel like someone's grabbed my throat and is squeezing those tears out of me. Shit, it sometimes feels like a boa constrictor's got me. It always happened when I had to do a public presentation in school or University. I used to try and speak as quickly but also as clearly as possible just to get it done with, but every so often I'd be halfway through a sentence and have to run because I'd started crying. Because I'd hear a little voice going ""You're fucking it up. They're looking at you make a fool of yourself. You said that quote wrong. That's not how you pronounce it. That kid in the back is laughing at you, not with you.""   What I'd like for others to understand is that although I will need help in some areas of my life (mainly social, looking after myself properly) I'm not stupid. I'm pretty average in intelligence, I just suck at talking. I'm doing fine with this post but that's because I can type it up and if I make a mistake I can just delete it and re-do it. You can't do that when speaking. Yes, you can apologise if you accidentally say a slur, or say a word wrong, but it's not the same. When I speak to someone, or in my case try and FAIL to speak I stammer, and 'uhhh....' and 'ummm...' and panic that I used the wrong word to describe something. I often don't know what to even start the conversation beyond ""Hello!"" Like, I just stand there for what to me feels like a damn hour going ""Hello.....uhhhh.....mmm......so, ....uh....."" The reason why is because suddenly I get an Autistic block preventing me from thinking straight. I'm wondering what to say. The weather's kind of cra...no, that's boring and stupid. Maybe talk about TV...TV's pretty crap and I'm always watching entertainment on my computer, so unless they know who RoosterTeeth are I'm fucked. Politics then? With TRUMP as President? Be careful! They could be a brown shirt in denial! Stupid internet videos? Again, they might be more a TV fan.   ""So, the weather's kind of crap, isn't it?""  Oh, and don't bother with Autism Speaks. They can go fuck themselves because for one thing they don't have a single autistic person on their board and when a parent of an autistic child said child Autism Speaks say that it's 'Understandable' as the child was 'a burden to the family'. Fuck off. Oh, and they're raising funds to find a cure. Again, FUCK OFF. Sure, Autism isn't great but I've got it and I don't want to be seen as a pest, or something to be pitied and 'cured'. I'm human, treat me like one.   TL:DR : Autism varies from person to person, but it's like having several mental blocks preventing me from being 'normal', I'm overly sensitive to many senses and I'm pretty weird usually. But then, everyone has their oddities, why should I be any different?"
"I used to work as a social worker in NYC. I help young adults with autism and developmental disabilities get assimilated into society such as learning how to maintain relationships, jobs, and self maintenance. There was a young gentleman by the name of Mike. He was a bright young man and I could tell he had a lot of things bottled up. He wasnt very auditory, and only speaks when spoken to. He would have episodes where he would jump up and down in place and flair his arms around and stare straight up. eventually i learned that he does this when he gets excited about something and this was his go to motion to calm himself down.   In terms of communication, it was definitely very difficult in the beginning as I wasnt sure if he was understanding much of what I'm talking to him about. He would usually answer in one word responses and give out a very sarcastic haha. imagine you ask a person what they like to eat, and his response is to stare straight into my eyes and in all seriousness say ""chicken"", pause for 2-3 seconds, and let out the most sarcastic ""HaHa"" with his stone face and no emotion in it. I wasnt sure if he understood, if he was making fun of me, or he just learned it somewhere and started incorporating it into his daily speech. I would do home visits, take him out to the walk around, encourage him to play sports, etc just to get to know him better and build up his trust in me. I would take him to places he likes to be just to see how he is in his comfort zone. I noticed that he loves breaking things, not because he was mischievous, but it was actually something he enjoyed doing. He wasnt able to hold any jobs because he would start throwing things and smashing them on the ground. He previously worked in the kitchen of a restaurant just cleaning up and etc and he would be smashing plates and other kitchenware. it was very difficult for him to maintain any job and his mom was getting very burned out. she wasnt kicking him out of the house or anything but she really want him to be able to take care of himself in case something was to happen to her. she was an older lady who adopted Mike when she was younger. He is in his mid 20s and she was already in her 60s. She keeps worrying to if she passes and hes left alone by himself, he wont be able to live.  I put in a lot of time and effort in order to make sure he could become independent. the whole process took about a year, when my colleagues were able to convince a business owner to hire Mike with me supervising him every step of his job until we both agree that he can do his tasks without my supervision. He got his first full time job at a glass bottle recycling company. His job was to manage the glass crushing machine. His task was to load up the conveyor belt with empty glass bottles that would bring the bottles into a larger contraption that would crush the bottles into tiny pieces and falls into large containers to be bought to melt down. He was the happiest i have ever seen him, watching glass break and being allowed to physically throw the bottles into the machine if necessary.  I believe that he is still working there right now and the other staff there has been a huge blessing. they would encourage him and praise him for his work. I remember my last day at the agency when i told everyone that i would be moving on in my career and it would be my last week there. for the first time in 2 years, he walked up to me, held out his hand to shake mine and said in the most serious and mature voice ive ever heard come out of him, ""Thank You""  That moment defined everything that i have been working for and i was so proud of him. I knew he had it in him and it took a lot out of him to say that to me. He went from a boy trapt in a man's body to a grown man who still has his disadvantages, but i couldnt be more proud of him.  This job has completely changed my view of anyone who has a disability. I used to think it was a shame and i wish there could be something that could be done to help everyone. What i learned was we can, we just need to put our time, heart, and passion to help them ourselves and not expect someone else to do so.  That was about 4 years ago. It was a tough job, but just hearing the words ""thank you"" made every hardship worth it. Working 12 hours a day for minimum pay was very draining for me and my family, but i would never regret my experience there."
"It's a combination of two things.  **Empathy Defect:**  You know those ubiquitous ""click 'like' when you see it"" photos, and the ones that say, ""when you see it, you'll scream""? A photo that looks perfectly ordinary, but it takes you a long time to notice an important detail? Or maybe you couldn't even find the important detail, somebody had to point it out to you? And you know how, afterwards, you wonder how you didn't see it sooner?  That's what almost every situation where other people's emotional reactions to something are important feels like to us. We're perfectly capable of seeing and hearing what's in front of us. And afterwards, when somebody says, ""didn't you realize that she was flirting with you?"" or ""didn't your realize that he was angry at you?"", you can sort of see how you were supposed to have figured that out. If you're high functioning because of intense training (like me), you might even wonder how you didn't see it at the time. But at the time, you just didn't see it.  **Sensory Processing Defect:**  Ever been in a room with loud music that you don't like and a strobe light right in your eyes? Our brains just do that to us randomly; an ordinary room with ordinary background noise and ordinary conversations with people using their indoor voices hit us like a deliberate sensory-overload chamber would hit you. And we can only escape that feeling the same way you would: retreat to somewhere less glaring, less disorienting, and quieter.  A lot of tantrums by autistic people are the entirely predictable result. Imagine if you were in a sensory-overload chamber and somebody who wasn't bothered by such things demanded that you pay full attention to what they were saying and follow their complicated instructions, when you can't even hear what they're saying over the deafening noise, gut-wrenching nausea, and/or intense disorientation. Damned right you'd yell the same thing an autistic person does: ""leave me alone!"" And if they didn't, you might well hit them trying to push them away."
"This will probably get buried, but w/e  I have Asperger's Syndrome (yes, I was actually diagnosed).  My experience was initially very similar to that of other commenters: the standard mix of awkwardness, sensory sensitivity and inability to read emotions or recognize people.  Around my 18th birthday -- about 11 years ago, I was depressed, lonely, and had very few friends.  For the past few years, my parents questioned if I would complete high school. I decided that I wasn't going to let this disorder take over my life, and constructed a plan to overcome this condition.  Breaking down the syndrome into its individual symptoms, I attacked each one individually  * In response to clumsiness, I picked up piano, and trained myself to be ambidextrous * To be more physically attractive, I started lifting weights and jogging * To be more interesting, I started rock climbing, and read the Economist and Hacker News daily * I studied educational material from the seduction community to gain some basic social skills (this intermittently got me into trouble later); Likewise, books on body language and charisma were of some help (How to Win Friend and Influence People, as well as What Every Body Is Saying, are highly recommended) * I forcibly desensitized myself to bright lights, loud noises and physical contact * I built a limited framework which mitigates my facial blindness * Likewise, I chose my hobbies to be athletic things in which I can operate in small groups -- helping me stay fit while simultaneously playing to my strengths and rounding myself out as an individual! * I experimented with nasal Oxytocin (a neurotransmitter whos deficiency is known to be related to Aspergers) with limited or no results * I explored my genome (via raw data from 23andMe) searching for likely genetic markers associated with Aspergers (limited results -- research just wasn't there yet as of two years ago) * In order to get consistent feedback for improvement, I reveal that I have Asperger's to almost every single trusted individual.  I ask all of them for advice and feedback (in exchange for beer or baked goods!) * Finally, I intentionally turned myself into an individual who is extremely supportive, attentive and friendly.  Pieces of my behavior here are little ""patches"" to mitigate when my reading of social cues and emotions are a bit sluggish -- it does a pretty good job of hiding the bits I'm still working on.  It has been a long road, but well worth it.  I transferred from a semi-prestiguous university to one that was more sociable, so that I could get more practice.  Later, I transferred back so that I could make a difference in the world.  I graduated with my BS in 5.5 years total, moved to California and worked for NASA.  I'm now in my final year of my PhD program at a research institute you've heard of.  Eleven years ago, when I asked people for social advice, they would sit down and tell me the five weird things they've noticed.  Seven years ago, the typical person could only tell me that ""they felt something weird or 'off' about me, but they couldn't say what"".  Starting about four years ago, people are completely unaware that I have a condition.  Today, people regularly tell me that I'm one of the most charismatic and sincere people they know.  I wasn't able to completely resolve everything:  Lip reading during loud parties is far from perfect, and my responses to Facial Blindness are hacks at best.  Speaking of which, if there are any compelling solutions or training methods for facial blindness, I would be much obliged!  Photos can't really describe a change in social skills, but here you are: Before (~3 years into the project, really): https://www.dropbox.com/s/gzlyt9ploybb2vk/old1.jpg?dl=0 https://www.dropbox.com/s/z2h2ct0dr3zwq8p/old2.jpg?dl=0  And this past year: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6qgkdgjq85tmhh0/new1.jpg?dl=0 https://www.dropbox.com/s/udkt7t1yyvsvyi7/new2.jpg?dl=0 https://www.dropbox.com/s/wml1xj8c3rmzqac/new3.jpg?dl=0  Anyone who's interested in chatting more is welcome to reply to this comment or drop me a PM!"
"For me autism is normality so it's hard to explain it. I have aspergers and I wasn't diagnosed until I was 29 so I am considered ""high functioning"".  Basically I was diagnosed with anxiety and a high intelligence from a young age so people used to kind of put a ""sensitive genius"" label on me rather than autism because I was a girl and girls tend to get diagnosed later than boys if at all.  What was interpreted as anxiety, which is generally a comorbidity with autism, was my trains of thought moving too quickly combined with my sensory issues. I have multiple trains of thought running at all times. They run fast like bullet trains and when I can get them all running in the right directions I will have a really amazing and productive day. Usually a couple will fuck up and go all over the place though and this is an average day. I'm either trying to ignore it or manage it. Both take energy.   So with these trains of thought, I might be doing really well with them and then suddenly someone comes into the room wearing perfume, or maybe I'll walk into a room with a horrible colourful patterned carpet. Whatever it might be, it is so strong to me because of my sensory issues that I can't process anything else and it basically derails all the trains. When the trains derail I have what is known as a meltdown.  For me my mind sort of shuts off and I lose my ability to speak. I become non verbal and need to shut myself away in a controlled environment to reset my mind. I also don't like people to see me like this as I tend to rock back and forth and tap my head with my hand, and tap my feet rapidly. I look odd to someone who doesn't understand. I used to run to the bathroom to engage in this behaviour at school. Probably another reason didn't pick up on me having autism until much later.   I've always taken things too literally. Jokes have often gone over my head because I miss things. I need more time to process what people say because I take language very literally and take things at face value. You can't be passive aggressive with me. It won't work, I will not pick it up. If you tell me you are fine and you aren't too bad.   Also as I take my context from your choice of words rather than tone because tone is harder for me to read I need you to choose them carefully. This also makes vagueness harder for me to stomach because I rely so much of the specifity of your words. For instance ""Soon"" is too ambiguous a word. Give me specifics. Ambiguity gives me intense anxiety. If things are ambiguous I can't put them in a list or schedule in my mind. Everything for me needs to be timed and categorised. I couldn't stop it if I wanted to. It just happens automatically.  For instance when I meet someone new my mind pulls out a checklist from a file cabinet in my mind and tells me what I need to do. Smile. Make eye contact. Say hi and introduce yourself. Offer your hand to shake. It's not a choice I made to make a list and see a file cabinet, it's just always been that way.   Relationships are difficult because of my tendency to take people at face value and struggle to read between the lines. People can also struggle with my frankness, and how chatty I can be if you get me on to a topic I consider a special interest. I don't always realise I'm not letting anyone else get a word in because my brain is moving so fast I feel like I've only said a tiny amount even though I've been rambling on and on.   I also tend to be very black and white. There's a strong sense of right and wrong because I dislike ambiguity. I try very hard to process grey areas but they just sit so badly with me. I tend to cut people out of my life who disagree with me if they keep talking about it because it causes me physical distress to think about it. I have a checklist for peacefully resolving things like political disagreements now though where I take a deep breath, say we shouldn't discuss this subject any more, agree to disagree and either shake hands or hug it out depending on my bond with the person.   I also find neurotypical people want a lot more from me than I am at times capable of giving. Like in a romantic relationship they can move very quickly and feel things in the early stages and want a lot of my time which I find intense and off putting. I need a reasonable amount of alone time each day. If I don't have that I get really distressed and have meltdowns. I find I spend a lot of my time managing the expectations of neurotypical people and it's very tiring.   I also think there's a misconception that people with ASD don't have as much empathy or care as much but for me I feel like it's the opposite. Like externally I appear shut down or I might now show emotion but internally it's like a raging sea. When my cousin died I was a wreck inside but maybe externally people might think I didn't care much because I seem so stoic and unmoved. The reason I shut down is because I feel so much I can't process anything else.   I guess in summary for me I guess the world just feels faster, louder, brighter, and smellier than it does to most people. It's more confusing because things for me are more black and white and I can't always tell if people are saying what they mean or how they really feel. I often feel like the world would be simpler if more people just said what they wanted instead of expecting people to guess. "
"I have a 17 year old with high functioning autism.  Autism is lonely.  She doesn't really have any friends, even though she's the sweetest person you'll ever meet.  She's very shy, but once you get to know her she's great.  Problem is, she has issues with social interaction.  I remember at several of her childhood birthday parties she seemed content to be off on her own doing whatever, while the other kids socialized.  The few times she did invite friends over, she really didn't know what to do with them.  I actually had to teach her what to do when people come over...what kinds of activities can you do together?  How to be a good hostess, etc.  Stuff like that does not come naturally to people with autism. She is also very childlike, which I understand can be very common in autism.  She loves little kids and probably understands them better than anyone.  She will get down on the floor and play barbies with little kids and probably enjoy it just as much they do.  I read that people with autism can retain their childlike wonder for the world throughout their lifetimes, which I think is actually pretty awesome :) My daughter is one of my best friends, and I love her so much.  I hate that she has to struggle so much, but the very things that make her unique (autism) make her the wonderful human being that she is. <3"
"Frankly, life's a bit shit because of the old 'tism. As it turns out I had been autistic for years without knowing it. This, unfortunately, meant that I went without help, resources, or understanding from many people. I had emotional breakdowns all throughout elementary school and middle school. To accent this all I live in Nevada, which last I checked was the 50th in the nation for education.      All of this came to a head when I was horribly beaten by a group of black kids in 6th grade and it was never acknowledged by the gym teacher or any of the school faculty as two of the people were the varsity basketball stars. From there I was homeschooled for two years and went to one of the worst high schools in the state under a magnet program. The teachers didn't care, no one really did. Ultimately I was kicked out of that school for having sleep apnea under the explanation that I was a 'disruption' at best and a bad student at worse. I was bumped around different charter schools until I found one that actually cared for its students.  It was there that someone brought the idea forward that I might actually be autistic as the school had several others who were on the spectrum. After a year of trying to convince the insurance to cover the test I was finally approved for it. Needless to say, my mother and I jumped on that and got it done immediately. Turns out I'm on the lighter end of the spectrum and had what used to be categorized as Asperger's. This didn't affect me too much, unfortunately, the diagnosis came too late to really help me. So here I am now, a 21-year-old aspie sitting at a computer at 5 am listening to depressing music writing up my life story in an ask reddit thread while caring for my elderly grandparents. I'm not really employable, I have depression, and live in a city that has no resources for people like me. I really wish life wasn't like this but compared to the others I've seen I'd rather it be this way.  Edit: As for actual physical stuff, it's hell. I like writing about fantasy worlds and all that jazz but my hands hurt from manual dexterity problems typical with autists. They hurt so much that I have to type everything and couldn't draw a straight line if I wanted to. All these neat landscapes in my brain are just wasting away because I can't get them down in words, words that even if I knew, wouldn't be able to be as thorough as a digital painting. The absolute worst part, however, is the fact that I just can't handle stress and have depression. Talking to someone or waiting for a response from a text is the literal worse. but really the worst thing, the thing that makes existence hell for me is the fact that I'll never be normal. I wanna be normal, I really do, but I can't. I cant shut my stupid trap, I can't have a job, I cant drive because I'm scared of cars, I just wish I was regular and had none of the 'different abilities' that autists are often associated with."
This thread is making me think that I have autism.
"When I was younger it was hell. I always wondered why friends in elementary school-middle school would abandon me for someone ""better"". From that time span I was very lonely but I coped and took this time to try to teach myself to function properly. This has resulted in my high school life being better. I've dated, held friendships and have just been acting ""normal. Of course, i still spazz out.  However I was always annoyed with my parents trying to help with these autistic groups. I was usually annoyed with other autistic kids. "
"Most of what I would say has already been said, but if it's ok I'd like to add my input.   If it wasn't for our current society, being autistic would be completely fine.   I feel like we autistic people aren't something to frown upon, but just people who see the world differently. Something with our brains cause us to see, hear, feel, and function differently from what our society is deemed ""normal"".   What society must learn is that ""normal"" doesn't exist. It can't possibly exist, because no two humans are alike. No two brains work identically.   Not all people are the same. Some are more or less social than others. Some have heightened or lowered senses. Some of us are more easily overwhelmed than others. Some people are unable to form sentences, but that doesn't mean we don't understand what everyone else is saying. Some of us talk out of our asses, and some of us aren't the best at finding the right words to say. Some of us don't express emotions outwardly, but that doesn't mean we feel just as much, if not more, on the inside. And some of us are too outwardly emotional for others to handle all at once.   And that's okay.  So if society can learn and adapt to a world where there is no normal. Maybe we can live in a world where autistic and non autistic can coexist without any trouble at all. A world where being autistic is not considered a ""burden"". And a world of Peace, Love, and Understanding.  Sorry, because I have a tough time speaking in person, I end up writing in novels."
"I have Aspergers. I am just going to write little snippets in bullet points since that is easier for me. * I have trouble articulating my thoughts sometimes. I have the ideas but I have trouble expressing things. * I am over-critical of myself, but that may be linked more to anxiety. * When I was younger (Kindergarten through second grade) I had  a meltdown (often bordering on panic attack) almost every school day (even though I love school). * I started to speak very early (about 11 months) and always had an impressive vocabulary. However, I had difficulties with phonetics.  * I was lucky to have one good friend who introduced me to her friends. * I was expelled from 6th grade because they didn't know how to help me and some of the staff didn't care and bullied me.  "
"The number one aspect of Autism to realize is that it is a spectrum disorder. That is, there are a huge number of traits, which some people will have, and others won't, and some traits that may be present in a lot of us.  As an analogy, think of people going to a salad bar - They may each have completely different ingredients in each of their salads, but they all have a salad.  Autism is like that. 2 people may have the same exact diagnosis, and almost no overlap in symptoms.  I've got 2 kids on the spectrum - one diagnosed with Asperger's, one with PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) It basically means ""we know it's in the autism spectrum, but doesn't perfectly fit the diagnosis of Asperger's or of Classic Autism, so we are putting it in the miscellaneous drawer."" I'd probably be somewhere on the spectrum as well near the Asperger's side of things, if I had been diagnosed as a kid.  (Yeah, they have changed the labeling to group them all under a single heading of Autism, but I'm going with the DSM 4 definitions, because it makes things more clear when specifying a specific group within the autism spectrum.)  As for the things that hold true for me and my 2 sons -   Physical Awkwardness + Clumsiness - All of us had problems riding a bike, Tying Shoes or knots of any kind, really bad at sports and most things requiring coordination.  Social stuff - we have a lot of problems interpreting non-verbal cues and emotions of others. We also have problems expressing our emotions in the same way others do.   My son was completely stone-faced at his grandfather's funeral. He loved him deeply and was extremely torn up about it, but could not express it the way that most people do. That difficulty expressing and reading people's emotions is sometimes interpreted as a lack of empathy, but in fact we have extreme empathy for others - we just really suck at showing it correctly, and in telling what others are trying to show to us.  A lot of reluctance to engage socially. I've gotten better at this, but I was probably in my 30s before I caught up on social maneuvering skills that most people had in college. Same for my sons, they have a very limited number of friends, compared to their siblings who are social magnets.  We are all 3 very smart on academic subjects - not so much in street smarts or other areas. Although I've outgrown it, both my boys have real issues with tone of voice, and speaking rhythm.  Sensory issues are bad for us - put us in a crowded room or noisy area, and it's really hard to take. I'm particularly bad about strong smells - too much perfume by an office coworker (or god forbid nail polish remover with Acetone!) and I've got a severe headache right away.  We all have our very strong interest areas. Luckily, since my oldest son was a first grader and I became his Den leader, my special area of interest has been Scouting. It has been a great tool for me to come out of my shell by working with other parents, and their kids, and having all 4 of my kids involved in an activity that is good for them, and an involved parent.

"You're luck I just woke up and don't feel like writing much, or else this comment would be ten pages long. Basically, on my worst days I hate it, and on my best days I tolerate it. One of my biggest problems is that I don't fit the stereotype of the guy who loves video games and computers and is a math genius. I'm a girl who sucks at all things STEM (I can draw very well, though, and can go on for hours talking about art). This is a problem because it always seems like both neurotypical people and autistic people want nothing to do with me, because I'm different from both of them.   I used to be a lot worse off in some areas autistic people struggle with (i.e. fashion, talking to people) but I've recently been training myself to be more normal in these areas. It helps that I have a twin sister who isn't autistic and helps me with stuff like that. But even though things have been getting better, they're still not good. As a lot of other people have already said, it's lonely as hell. There's never a moment in my day in which I'm not reminded that I have autism. I give so much thought to every little thing I do, every movement I make, because I'm afraid that I'm somehow messing up the normal exterior I've worked so hard to build.   I know all of this sounds kind of weird, but it's how I live. For the most part I've gotten used to it, but it still sucks. Thank you for asking the question, though-- everyone could use a little more knowledge on the subject."
"What I notice most about myself, I copy other people socially because I don't have a clue how to behave. So I notice that I am socially not very good and often get very insecure about this. Resulting in me becoming very silent and stressed. Also I don't eat when I am stressed. And I get very tired of social interactions because I essentially play a role and have to stay 'in character '. I also do not function well with a lot of stimuli in my environment resulting in me becoming unwell and sometimes faint. "
"You have a certain way of thinking.  Point A brings you to Point B,  then maybe Point C.  My way of thinking is Point A takes me straight through to Point C,  then it may or may not go back to Point B.  The most common thing I hear when people talk to me about a problem is,  ""I didn't think of that.""   Because I don't hit Point B first,  I miss a lot of things that people consider common sense.  Small talk,  how to behave ""appropriately"" in a group setting,  which way is north.   It also causes bigger issues. Like panic when something isn't where I left it.  Anxiety because I don't know what to say and this person is just staring at me.  Sensitivity to noises.  Nails on a chalkboard sucks for nearly everyone.  Imagine normal everyday hustle and bustle sounding like that.    People are unpredictable. Imagine being in a room with a lion.  Scary but you can keep your eye on it and be reasonably sure what it will do next.  Now imagine several lions in the room.  You can't watch all of them.  So now you panic and don't know which one to keep your eye on,  so you go back and forth between them.  In the end you aren't really able to watch any of them and now you feel helpless because you know you won't make it out alive.  You run for it,  out the door,  and are safely on the other side.  Exhausted and scared.   Clothing is constricting.  Like being completely tied up.  It's uncomfortable and difficult to move.  It really just doesn't feel right.    Imagine someone is trying to give you a set of instructions,  but they are doing it verbally.  You realize a couple sentences in that the person is speaking a language you kind of know,  so you are having to first translate it to your native tongue before you can fully understand it.  They,  however,  don't pause in their speech,  so while you are translating in your head what was already given to you,  they are now three steps further in the process.  Because following instructions is the rule,  you give up your attempt to translate because you have missed some steps.  Now you don't know what to do.  If they had written it down,  it would have been in your native speech and you could follow it.   That's what it's like for me.  "
"I a form of high functioning Autism called ""Asperger's Syndrome"" and I feel that I can  function like most other people in the world. But I do find some small social ques are hard to pick up along with having sympathy for them.   Also: I have really good memory, and I'm good with solving problems.  Edit: added another fact. Edit 2: Aspergers is under the Autism spectrum because of insurance coding."
