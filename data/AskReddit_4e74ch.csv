"This has been said here before, but that autism is a spectrum. I'm probably one of the only people on here who has severe autism. I cannot talk vocally. I needed/need many supports. I hate when people, especially people who are higher functioning with less severe autism, try to say that we should not treat autism but accept them as they are. My parents tried that. I beat myself and them up for years and was basically lost and trapped. Teaching me the skills I deserved to know. Like how to communicate, saved my life.   Also. IQ is separate from the autism spectrum. So you can have a high IQ and severe autism (me) or any combo. But surprisingly, the kids with low IQ and severe autism are often hidden from society's view."
"That I don't want your pity. I've never not had autism, I've never experienced anything without it, I generally don't care about the fact that I have autism and I never think about it. Other than my general social awkwardness, general lack of understanding of certain cues or contexts, and my crippling social anxiety, the only way to not make me feel like shit honestly is to treat me like you would tread anyone else. Also, autism is on a spectrum, and no two people who have it are exactly the same. Until I was 12, I and the people around me thought I had ADD, and since I was 5 I was prescribed Adderall until I was reevaluated and diagnosed with Autism. My personal symptoms are usually hard to pick up for someone if the aren't actively looking for them. Just treat me normally. I don't want pity. I don't want sympathy. I want the same respect from you that you give to anyone else."
"Autism Speaks is a horrible, horrible organization. Don't listen to a word they say.  Edit: I got gilded? I got gilded! Thank you, stranger!"
"As someone with high functioning autism and a sensory processing disorder, it is often not apparent that I even have it because I have been taught how to hide it very well, however it still shows sometimes. Autism manifests differently in different people.    What would help me the most is if people could understand that I really am trying hard to understand other people. Something that hurts me might not hurt you, and what is interesting and fun to me might be completely boring to you. I sometimes accidentally offend others or take forever to understand a joke. It doesn't mean I am weak, cold hearted, stupid, or not trying hard enough.  Im a little different but its not a big deal, just have some patience.   "
"""I just can't"" is absolutely a thing. Sometimes the brain just shuts down and you can't operate. It's frustrating for, but horrifying for us. "
"It's a spectrum-based disorder, so it can manifest itself in a wide variety of ways. One you've met one person with ASD, it's very unlikely the next person you meet with ASD will exhibit identical behavior. "
"The number of times I heard ""no, you're not autistic"" or ""but you can speak"" is frightening. Autism is a spectrum and it can manifest itself in many different ways. It's fine not to know a lot about it, but don't try to correct me and a bunch of doctors who diagnosed me, because you clearly don't know shit.   Please, stop treating me like a child. I understand you might want to help, but constantly asking if I'm sure I can take bus by myself or praising me for hours after I make an appointment is pretty insulting. Yes, I have Aspergers, but I'm 18 and totally capable of doing pretty much everything other people my age can.   ""Don't touch me"" means ""don't touch me"". Forcing a hug is not friendly, it's causing me extreme distress. "
"My twin was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome when we were nine. I never have been, but on every test I always fell kind of halfway between high functioning autistic and neurotypical. Growing up, I always served as an intermediary in conflict between my parents and my twin because I could understand both perspectives.   The main thing that sticks with me from this experience is that, although autism is perceived as a deficit in understanding, it's really not that simple. The deficit in understanding my neurotypical parents tended to show was often just as profound as my twin's, sometimes more. Often what I noticed is that she's the one who saw certain things with a clarity that they didn't have -- for example, what a waste of time and energy many of the social expectations society places on people really are. She exists in a world with rules that *objectively make no sense* that people just keep telling her are important (because they are, but for ""bad"" reasons, like ""tradition"" and ""expectations""), and it's not that she doesn't understand what they're saying and needs them to keep explaining it, but that she hears them, considers it critically, and rejects it. So they'd always be talking past each other.   For my whole life, my twin has challenged me to think outside the box and not take the expectations of society at face value. In my opinion, hers is a really valuable perspective on social behaviour, not a ""handicapped"" one."
"1) A lot of us are really, really lonely. It's much harder for us to make friends, harder still for us to keep them.  2) We are *much* more likely to suffer from depression than normal folks. (Edit: link wasn't to correct study, will try to get that in later.) You know all that moody emo stuff teens can go through, where they feel like they're difference and ""don't fit into society's mould""? Well, imagine having that literally be true.  3) For a slightly different tone than some of the other commenters: if an autistic guy or girl acts like a jerk, then says ""It's not my fault I'm socially inept, it's my autism."" or something to that regard, they absolutely are a jerk. It's not a valid excuse; it's like making a culturally-incorrect gaff, then saying ""It's not MY fault I didn't grow up [x culture]!"" (Then continues to repeat the offense...) The correct response would be for them to apologize, and try and work on not making a similar gaff."
"That not all autistic people are completely hopeless when to comes to social interaction. I've been diagnosed with autism for years and I got over my fear of social communication years ago and am doing perfectly fine. Just because I'm autistic, doesn't mean that I always say cringy things to other people."
Being inept socially means I don't get bullying and can't defend myself against bullies.  If you see someone on the spectrum being bullied you may be their only hope for any kind of defense.
"Some days will be really, really rough for me and the last thing I need is you forcing me to do things that set me off. I'll be really frustrated and stressed out, then get angry and lash out because you're pretty much just torturing me after a certain point. If I'm having a good day, it's easier for me to cope so if you really want to do something you know stresses me out, ask me how I'm feeling about it first.  Also, I know that sometimes you just want me to relate to your emotions about something and sound really caring and genuinely warm when comforting you. But I can't do that. My emotions are different than yours and you're asking me to relate to something I know nothing about. And yes, I do have emotions, I'm not a robot. They're just different from yours because my brain is wired differently."
"That simply ""getting over it"" isn't as easy as they think"

"Autism often presents itself differently in girls than in boys. Commonly known autism behaviours don't necessarily apply to girls. If you're wondering if you or a girl you know is autistic, look up the symptoms more commonly seen in women. I am almost 24 and have only just realized I'm probably autistic because the behaviours most often associated with autism in media and public knowledge don't really apply to me."

That it is not caused from vaccines.
"A few things:  1. I'm a female with Asperger's. No one believes I have it and have been called ""perfectly sociable"". That being said, I am always anxious during my interactions with other people, always second guessing, always scripting. 2. As someone else mentioned, making friends is HARD, and don't even get me started on romantic relationships. That being said, it doesn't mean that we don't crave or need it less than anyone else. Loneliness is a big problem for us. 3. The world in general is a very overwhelming place. Adulthood is incredibly overwhelming, offices with politics, social gatherings, jobs, bills, keeping my space clean, etc. I struggle with all of these things. People will judge me into oblivion, but they don't know what I am going through. 4. Most people with Asperger's are perfectly kind and sweet, but we live in an overly judgmental society (the US in particular), that pays too much attention to the way people behave during small talk. If someone comes off a little awkward, give them a chance, they are trying. It's hard."
1. The autism spectrum isn't a slider of  'more autistic-------------- less autistic' it's more like a grab-bag of traits. Like one person might be nonverbal while the other person might have intense sensory issues.  2. Don't support Autism Speaks.  3. Don't use autistic as an insult/negative connotation. I see some people in here saying they're fine with it but it's not the same for everyone. For some of us it dredges up horrible feeling and/or experiences. 
"We have this disorder for life. I mean sure, we can learn better in select areas, but no matter what, we'll always be like this to some extent until we die."
"That watchin Rain Man doesn't make you an expert on it.  Autism is extremely varied and not a single thing. People with autism spectrum disorders act all kinds of ways. Most just want to behave normally, and more than a few succeed.   When you joke that someone is ""acting autistic"" you're reinforcing a strong misconception about what it means to have autisms."
"It's hurtful to use autism as an insult. Frankly, I don't understand how people can rag on people with autism for lack of empathy or bad social skills yet can be so unapologetically rude in the same posting. If you try to call them out or protest at all then you're just mocked for being oversensitive.    I dunno. I guess ever since I've been diagnosed my thoughts and opinions have stopped mattering to anyone who knows. Any strengths or weaknesses I have is just the autism. "
"It's a spectrum. People can have it and it be barely noticable, it's not just severe.  "
"As someone stated below- adulthood is terrifying. All these expectations, at least half of which I don't understand. Taxes are confusing as hell, so left to my own devices I'll just ignore them. Lots of rules are that way. I understand paying for things, but I tip at a fixed rate. I have never once cared about procedure unless it has a physical reason. I organize mostly by inertia.  Romance is a terrifying prospect- I want it at least as much as the next person, but the silent no will miss me entirely. Did I mention I'm huge and people (mostly women) are a little afraid of me, even though I have the muscle tone of a globster? Combine those and I'm a sex offense looking for a place to happen, because being scary is a crime. Don't pretend it's not. ""Why didn't you say anything?"" ""Because I was afraid of you."" At least I won't have to worry about housing.  Jobs. Don't get me started. How do I get past the screening? What should my cover letter say? How about my resume? Why doesn't this process have a unifying pattern to learn? If I could use a cheat code to get a job, I would. As it is, my prospects are minimum wage despite my skills. Never finished college because I couldn't make my own way- the load was paralyzing when I was young and now I'm too old. (32)  Housing. Yeah, I'm on disability. If my parents die, I can't afford to live anywhere *civilized.* (Which sounds racist but isn't. Classist, sure. Not racist.)  Comorbid mental disorders. Hi, depression and anxiety! What? Give up because life is terrifying and I'm worthless? Sure, why not. Put on Dark Souls and pass the margarita.  Yes, I'm a little bitter. People wonder why I put such a high value on spiting people who would exploit me? It's not hard, honest. I hate feeling guilty for not being perfect, but I live with it all the time because my skills were the one way I made myself desirable, and now the practical skills don't matter at all if the social is lacking. I can be a good person. I can do a job phenomenally if given the chance. I can't get past the part where I'm either laughed or tossed out the door because my thoughts are so divergent that I cause offense by my nature. The perversity of the universe increases to a maximum, and I find it funny. I just don't know what the rest of you people want."
"Using a throwaway for this as I do not disclose my diagnosis for my own reasons.  Contrary to what many have seen on various autism sites used by autistics (I won't be surprised if I get downvoted), not everyone likes this whole ""neurodiversity"" thing, some of us want to be cured."
I feel like people need to have more patience with us since we're usually not going to understand something right away if it's a new concept  For example I'm terrible at understanding sarcasm; I'll end up thinking they're serious and it ends up leading to people calling me a retard a dumbass and other stuff
"* Most ""mental health advocates"" view us as props and tools to make themselves feel better.  Virtually everyone I know who posts things on Facebook like ""Don't say 'retarded!'"" and ""If you're depressed and need to talk to someone, I'm willing to listen"" are judgmental as hell and don't want anything to do with you.  They see you as too awkward to talk to and shush you away, even though they preach acceptance of the mentally ill.  Similarly, I really don't care if you use ""retarded"" or ""autistic"" as an insult as long as I know you're joking.  * I may be autistic, but I'm not retarded.  I have trouble processing social cues, but that doesn't mean you should talk to me like you're an American tourist in a non-English speaking country.  * The best way to talk to me is to *treat me like anyone else*.  Don't ostracize me, but don't give me any kind of special treatment.  I want to be treated as ""one of the gang"".  * Dating is unbelievably hard for me.  Not because I don't understand how relationships work, but because my social quirks and terribly awkward personality mean that most women don't want to talk to me after I approach them.  * I am terrified of accidentally raping a sexual partner because I misinterpret a social cue.  With the current online shaming culture and the only advice people give being ""Just read her body language to see if she's enjoying it!"", I am utterly fucked if I end up having sex with someone in a situation where I don't realize she isn't interested.  I actually hooked up with a close female friend once because I thought she was enjoying it, until she started crying in my bed because she felt manipulated.  * The reason I don't mention having Asperger's often is that people then start to view everything I do under that lens.  ""Oh he likes math?  Must be because he's autistic.  Oh, he's angry?  Must be autism.""  It's like if you were black and everyone assumed that you like fried chicken because you're black, rather than because it tastes good.  * Every single social interaction I have is scripted on my part.  I didn't know I should make eye contact until I was 7.  Whenever I talk to someone, I have to be fully conscious of my body movement, the tone of my voice, whether or I'm droning on about something that person doesn't care about, and every signal that the other person is giving off.  Naturally, this makes me terrified of coming off like a sociopath.  When I'm alone, I often just sit in my room and talk to myself and ""act autistic"" in a way that I can't do in public."
"Late to the thread here, but I hope I'm still relevant:  I am Aspergian, but on the more moderate side of the spectrum. I know I have my quirks, but not everything I do has to be analyzed like a peice of literature. Sometimes I do things just because I feel like it. I know I have repetitive eating habits. I like to make myself a PB after school each day. Some people call that common among Aspergians, but most people call that comfort food. I can make jokes about myself all I want, but sometimes I just want to be left alone while I recharge without being overanalyzed."
"Whenever someone feels a certain way, i often have to guess, and usually i get it right. Other times i just misunderstand, and even those who know me have at times taken offence :s.  Also, I have to ""manually"" kickstart my empathy, since i usually will not automatically share other peoples feelings. For example whenever someone feels sad or whatever. Then in order for me to step into their shoes so to speak, i have to remember back to when I was last feeling like (i am guessing) this other person is. Most of the time my empathy is homemade like this, but you can be certain that i only do this because i care!"
"Autistic adults exist.  So much of the marketing from groups like Autism Speaks focus on children with autism (depicting them as horrors visited on their parents, but that's a different rant), and virtually ignore the fact that those children grow up into autistic adults."
People glorifying autism as a 'blessing' do not represent people with autism.

"That there's little  benefit to claiming to have autism when you don't. I don't see it is much now, but it used to be a much more common assertion that a lot of people claim to have autism to justify acting like jerks. Now, there may be some autistic people who reject change and use their autism as an excuse, but the stigma against autism is great enough that if someone tells you they have autism *chances are they really do*. There's very little social benefit to claiming to have something that people immediately associate with Rain Man. Also, autism isn't always immediately recognizable. Some of my bets friends still refuse to believe that I have autism."

That we're not all like Christian Weston Chandler.
"Female with aspergers here, I'm not sure how to write this, but here goes...   Please don't be offended by lack of eye contact or not hugging you.  Socializing and friendship are extremely exhausting.   Please don't try to assume things about me.   I know you aren't really interested in my obsessions but it's nice that you listen to me. I appreciate it."
"Finally, seeing a thread where Autism Speaks is slammed :)   Asides from the deserved criticism of Autism Speaks, I would like people to know the following things:   - Although it is hard being autistic, it is not the fault of my being autistic. It is the fault of how I am treated due to that, there is nothing inherently wrong with me - a difference in neurology does not constitute an error.  -  Comorbidities. Yeah, I am autistic, but I also have OCD and some vague palsy like muscle issues as well as ulcerative colitis. People can have more than more thing, and it doesn't necessarily mean they are related- example; my anxiety is related, but my muscle tension/pain issues are not.  - Autism is not a condition that comes necessarily with intellectual disability, it can do and that's fine, but to assume every autistic person is afflicted with such a thing because of a socual deficit is really uncool.   The thing that has caused most trouble for me recently is a seeming inability to communicate with people. I worried that this was some sort of regression, but it has since been brought to my attention (by more socially adept friends) that the communication problems lie with those who are talking to me, because they are talking to me like a child and seem unable to understand that social/communicative deficit does not equal intelligence deficit.

"A couple of things: 1. Even though I've learned social skills it's still very difficult for me to connect with people. 2. I take longer to do things such as learn to drive and get a job. I am 21 and don't have either. 3. If I have weird body language don't take it personally. I don't know what my face is doing half the time and can look very serious without knowing it. If I don't look at you in the eye it doesn't mean that I don't like you. If my voice is monotone I'm either nervous, not sure what to say or I'm concentrating on my word output. 4. Get to know me! Sure I'm not the most outgoing person in the world but I still want to have friends and do stuff. I have a very big desire for friends.  5. Treat me like you would anyone else. All of us are different and need to be treated with the same amount of respect."
"If I dont recognize you right away, dont take it personally, its just that I have face-blindness. My SO of 4 years and even my parents are difficult to identify sometimes. You can help by consistently wearing an outrageous hat, growing a mustache, or just patiently reintroducing yourself. "

"That I don't need or want you playing ""diagnosis police"".   It seems like a trendy thing, especially online for people to pile on (and often harass) anyone they see identifying as autistic without acceptable proof of diagnosis. The people who do so are almost invariably never autistic themselves and seem to think they're sticking up for ""actually autistic"" people by outing the ""fakers"".  The result is that these people almost certainly cause significantly more harm to autistic people than any alleged fakers. Aside from the obvious traumatic impact to the alleged faker (who often is actually autistic as there are huge numbers of undiagnosed adults who have limited access to diagnosis resources), this constant questioning of people's diagnosis status impacts those of us who have been diagnosed as well.  It creates an atmosphere where we are constantly questioned on the validity of our diagnosis, where we are never taken as authorities on our own mental state, and where the burden of proof rests entirely on us (which we are often demanded to meet by complete strangers to satisfy nothing more than a whim).  To add to this, remember that this is all being demanded from a group of people that struggles significantly with communication, anxiety, and depression."

"I wish people would understand that just because I'm quiet and seem a bit odd doesn't mean that I'm not worth talking to. I often feel like my stimming (for those who don't know, ""stimming"" is basically any behavior that autistic people do to help calm themselves down) tends to make people feel afraid of me, since I do tend to act a bit erratic. I can't exactly help that, though, since, if I don't stim, then there's a much greater chance of my anxiety snowballing into a panic attack. I've especially found that, in job interviews, my stimming tends to get me ushered out of the interview pretty quickly, and that's a huge blow to my self-esteem.   Oh, and speaking of interviews, I wish there could be an alternate interview process for us autistic people, since the current interview process is based entirely on how good you are at socializing and pretending to be confident, and many of us autistic people really struggle with both those things. I've gotten rejected from so many jobs that I honestly feel like I could have done well at, simply because I couldn't manage to succeed at the bullshit interview process."

"As a person with Asperger's, if someone yell, snap, and/or get mad with you, your brain freeze and don't know what to say. Also, I just want to cry. :("
"I wish people would understand that this is who I am. I make funny noises when I'm happy. I need to be shown how to do something a few times to get it right on my own. I can't block out noises around me, because most of them are at the same volume for me. I have to wear a silicone chewing device,  because it's that or grinding my teeth from stress. I don't like being touched. I have issues with volume control. I can't eat some food because the texture is sensory hell.   This is all part of who I am. I'm autistic. Always have been and will be.  I'm living in a world that wasn't made with people like me in mind. Have some patience, this is hard for me,  too."
We're not your experiment to make into your ideal image nor want your pity that you call love.
"Autism isn't the same as down syndrome. I don't want preferential treatment. The best way to treat me is the same you would anyone else. Also, for fellow autistic people, don't expect the world handed to you on a silver platter. Work for your keep. Live your life how you want, not at bare minimum."
"We're not a bunch of Sheldon Coopers or Mr. Spocks. I'm on the high functioning end of the spectrum and most people wouldn't guess it.   Also, that my social interactions are pretty much scripted and planned to some degree. I had to teach myself how to fluctuate my voice so it doesn't sound monotone. I've had to teach myself to look at people when I talk and how to think before I say something. Still can't gauge facial expressions to save my life though. "
Autism doesn't only effect middle class white males.  The amount of times I've gotten the whole 'autism is for boys' and 'but there aren't black--' BS is way too often.

"It's not something you can just ""grow out of"". It's a lifelong disorder."
"I wasn't diagnosed until I was an adult and actually in college.  I am considered high functioning, high Iq.    1.  Antivaxxers, your view is largely backed up by one scientific paper that was then retracted due to shady dealings.  The counter to your view is backed up by multiple meta-analyses of large (tens of thousands) sample groups spread over multiple countries and conducted through multiple organizations.  I'm going to bet on the latter.    2.  Yes, I can speak, drive, do pretty much everything a normal person can, and then some.  I consider myself fairly lucky in those regards.  3.  I bounce between loving and hating physical contact.  If I'm comfortable with it, I'll initiate.    4.  Autism and mental retardation are not the same, nor is one dependent on the other.  Regardless of other symptoms, an autistic might be as intelligent as the average person, or even much more so.  5.  I don't always get jokes or sarcasm.  I am, however, very much a smartass.    6.  It is very isolating, but interaction is also exhausting.  "
"Using it an insult really fucking hurts.    Also, don't condescend to me, or think you're doing me a favor by hanging out and talking to me if you hate it and are just going to talk shit about me.  I stay to myself for a reason, you don't get to shove your way into my life and then complain like some martyr.    Also, if you use sarcasm at me repeatedly and it fails, it's not just me that's the problem, I can't help not always getting it but you can ALWAYS control whether or not you're sarcastic.  "
"To all the SJWs supposedly sticking up for me: fuck off. The words ""crazy"" or ""insane"" or ""retarded"" or any other ""ableist slurs"" don't  ""trigger"" me. I don't need your help. I don't WANT your help. I find it really ironic that you go around chastising people for being insensitive and then go right around and say ""get that through your thick skulls, you autistic neckbeards."" I don't need or want your coddling. I wouldn't wish autism on anyone. I would have loved to have been born a normal child and had a normal childhood. I wish there is a cure so nobody ever has to suffer like me or my parents did.   Oh and antivaxxers: when you talk about refusing to get vaccinated because you're afraid of autism, you're saying that you'd rather have a dead child than an autistic one.   Also, it's not ""person with autism."" It's autistic person. We have an adjective for a reason. That really grinds my gears. "
"All I want is for awkward teens to stop self-diagnosing themselves with ASD. If they knew what having ASD was like, they wouldn't want the label."
"Not all autistic people can't, or don't want to be social. Sometimes it's more of a matter of wanting to, but not knowing how due to issues with understanding social cues. The stereotype is of autistic people acting like little robots - that's not what we are!"
"That I just don't get some things.  I am great at almost anything English (but not remembering the terms for words. Ask me what a direct object is and I will stare at you. Blankly.), especially literature. I love writing. It's like knowing how to operate the machine but not knowing what parts make it up.  I'm utter shit at everything else, *especially* math of a difficulty higher than basic algebra. There's just something about the excessively long strings of numbers and formulas that my brain refuses to lock onto.  I also seem to have a problem with choosing the difficult route over the easy one. Sometimes I just plain WANT TO DO IT THE HARD WAY...despite there being an easy way. The thing is, I don't know the easy way and don't want to do it because it would require waiting to have it explained. Meanwhile I already know how to do it the hard way so dammit I'm going to do it that way! I'm extremely impatient.  The lack of confidence and how scary being a grown-up is. I can't believe that I'm old enough to drink booze whenever I want. I honestly feel like I aged up to 13 and never went past that.  The lack of noticing social cues (aka I don't know when to shut up!). I will bore the shit out of you talking about Frieza or someone from DBZ because I love things I love...until I don't anymore. I have a tendency to obsess for a period and then drop things.  I have two settings, high and off.  So, yeah. There's that."
that I cant tell whether you are joking with me or not.
"I'm 99% sure I'm mildly autistic, but I've never been properly diagnosed.  I wish people would understand that some people can't help being ""shy"" and it doesn't matter how much social interaction I have, I will still feel awkward.  Also, it's okay that I'm often in my own little world, I enjoy it there and I don't need to be pulled out of it. "
"Autistic person here, I see a lot of people talking about how misusing the word autism is hurtful. While I guess it is somewhat hurtful, I misuse the words retarded, crazy and paranoid pretty frequently, and it doesn't seem fair that only one of the four should be taboo (the one that pertains to me).   Another thing is that autism is a very large umbrella, under which you can find a staggering amount of different types of people. Some struggle to form words, some have a tough time in social situations and some experience next to none of this. Whenever autism is talked about, always ask yourself what kind of autism is being discussed and by whom. A parent group with severely autistic children may say one true thing about autism while a group of high-functioning autistic people may say a completely different, but equally valid, thing."
"That autism is kinda like a parallel psychology. It's like how if you've met one normal person, you haven't met them all. It's the same with autism.   And that people who unironically use autism as an insult is an ass. And that we're not all completely socially inept Spock-types, we try our hardest to pass. And that it can't be ""fixed"", you just have to work with it. Basically all the folks in this thread know what's up. "

I'm very good at hiding my autism because I've learned all the things I'm ""supposed"" to do in certain situations, and whenever I don't know I just try to keep quiet.   &nbsp;  But there are times where I have to think so hard about my response or how I approach people or conversation. All I want to do is make sure the person I'm talking to is happy, and that I'm replying to them with things that are relevant to what they're saying. But sometimes (a lot of the time) someone will say something to me and I genuinely have no idea why they said it or what they want to achieve from telling me. I don't understand what they want me to say, or what they're feeling about it or why. Sometimes someone says something and they seem upset but I have no idea why they're upset. But then I don't want to make the conversation be about me, and explaining to me something which is probably very obvious, so I try not to ask why. But then I just don't know the right thing to say and I get things wrong a lot. I just want people to understand that it can be a lot of hard work, but the effort isn't really visible. "
We aren't retards. We just see the world differently. 
"There are times when we get locked up. Every once in a while, all of a sudden my brain stops canceling out background noise and apparently I look like I'm having a stroke because I have to consciously think about what sound I am suppose to be paying attention to. Also, as mentioned before, ""I just can't"" is an accurate excuse. And the more people push at you the more everything aches for no reason and the only way to fix it (for me) is to get away from anything that causes stress because once it starts it will keep building unless that body inside my body (probably doesn't make sense to anyone) can mellow out. A lot of times it'll be writing a new program or something tedious that require full attention."
"What do I wish they understood? I dunno. What's to understand? I'm a failure at being human. I have constant pain and loneliness and no human interaction seems to exist other than smoking weed and playing video games. My personality results in me being ignored and not wanted.   Not sure what use it is to explain to anyone. I only am now cause I'm lonely and I'm watching my friends slowly get sick of me.  I guess you could understand that we do want company, even if it doesn't seem like it "

"We need acceptance not a ""cure"" for our disorders. Accommodating to our needs isn't necessary but it is really kind. We can take care of ourselves and for each other. I'm 16, I have an IQ of 130, and I'm autistic. People who are quirky or weird in a cute way might be on the autistic spectrum because autism is actually quite common but there's varying degrees and not a lot of education on it. Autism isn't harmful and it hurts a lot more when people treat us with pity than to just treat us like normal people. Because that's what we are. People."

"I personally prefer with autism, not autistic, because then I'm more than just autism."
"Don't judge someone that's autistic just as that; autistic. There are more to people with autism then just that. Some people I met judge me by that, and it hurts our (at least my) self-judgment and self/confidence. I really wish that people can just get to know a person before judging on what they heard, because, someone with autism has more to themselves then being autistic (or anyone else with that matter)."
"Oh boy. So many things. I'll list a few.  - Just because I don't act like the autistic child you grew up with, that doesn't mean that I am lying about my diagnosis. ASD presents differently in everyone. - Yes, I was vaccinated as a child. No, that's not why I'm autistic. STFU - I will get stuck sometimes. Sensory overload will cause me to freeze up and I can't move or talk until I get past it. I'm okay. You don't need to call 911. - I am literally incapable of assimilating your point of view into what I am doing on the fly. I'm not trying to be rude. What you're saying doesn't even make sense to me. Give me time to stop, process, and move forward. - I get tunnel vision. If it's important and you need me to hear and remember, then get my attention so that I make direct eye contact with you before telling me."
"Might jest be me, but dont spit out a bunch of follow up questions.  If its in a email or text that's fine but in person don't. For example if I say ""I want a taco for dinner"" don't say ""Ok, what shell do you want? Chicken or beef? how much cheese? with salsa? how much meet? do you want the shell warm? sour cream?"" and so on.  It gets overwhelming, just give me a taco.  P.S Thats why I dont go to Chipotle or Subway that much."
"I have mild functioning aspergers. For me I've been bullied since the day I went to school first.   I wish people would understand that people like me are a bit weirder. We don't understand social queues, how to speak, or act in stressful social situations. I have difficulty in huge crowds and 1 on 1, I believe I'm a blast. But I can't socialize with people I don't know. I get in trouble for social queues I don't understand, etc.   It's less of a ""I wish people"" individualy. But groups, corporations, academies. "
"It doesn't all look the same. I don't fit a lot of stereotypes, I'm not a male child with amazing math abilities, nor do I have meltdowns all the time (anymore, at least. I was not so lucky when I was younger). You can be a girl and autistic. You can function well and be autistic.  I feel like people don't believe I'm autistic cause I'm not a dude and I have no trouble with my job. Despite my other problems.   Aspergers is not a real diagnosis anymore and some autistic people find it offensive as it's percieved as the good autism. Don't ask me what kind of autism I have. It's just autism. Unless the person says they have aspergers don't say that over autism.  And ofc Autism Speaks is bad and sympathizes with parents who murder their autistic children, among other things."
"Autistic people do not (in almost all cases) need to be talked to like anything less than adult human beings.  I say almost all cases, as I understand some people who have more severe difficulties find it much easier to understand simpler language, etc."
"We are different, not less. We are not broken, we just learn differently."
"What a lot of people don't really get is that there isn't a normal person hiding under a ""layer of autism"". It's an integral part of who we are and how we see the world. I seriously doubt it can be cured, and even if it can, the results of essentially stripping away large parts of who a person is would not be pretty."
"As someone who knows a friend with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, I hate it when people think autistic people means low functioning/ retarded. Heck the spectrum is so wide that many might be affected by ASD and no know about it in their whole normal like lifes while laughing about others with ASD who are more obvious.   **No Single Person with ASD is the same.**"
That just because I have autism doesn't mean I'm retarded
"And well, here's the thing. Some of us, well, we ""look"" normal. Because we've spent most of our lives, learning by rote, what you expect us to act like. But unlike an average person, I'm doing this by... observation. I don't understand the purpose here, and the mask will show at edges. The mask is not there because I'm being fake, or decieving you. the mask is there because i'm covering the Giant Hole Where My Face Should Be. I am not lying to you, I'm trying to stop being all about that sucking face-void-hole."
"My observation is that Autism is (or at least certainly appears) most difficult for those raised by neurotypical parents and who are under pressure to be ""normal"".  If you treat autism like something that can be cured (rather than coped with) it creates the wrong expectations and doesn't help the child in the long run.  I can only speak for myself, but being raised by parents who were also on the spectrum allowed them to share life experiences with me that I needed.  Most of my family has Asperger's, or undiagnosed Asperger's traits.  They understood because they grew up with the same challenges I had, and they could share what worked for them.  The difference it made was tremendous.  I didn't feel like an outcast in my own home, and they were able to help me adjust to the simple idea ""We were born on the wrong planet.  It's their world, and this is how you survive in it.""  As a result we've all done pretty well for ourselves.  I'm a 3rd generation government contractor and we've all been involved in some form of engineering or software development.  Part of ""how you survive"" is finding the jobs that match our minds, and speaking to machines comes more naturally than speaking to people.  The sad irony is that the few neurotypical kids born into the family have struggled to fit in with the rest of us.  We jokingly call them ""the white sheep"" of the family, but it's true.  Our white sheep have completely separate social circles from the rest of us and live a life that most of the family just doesn't understand.  No one in our house knows how to help them or even what help they need.  They have to seek support from outside the family because their ""cold and emotionless family just doesn't understand what it's like to have feelings."""
It is annoying when groups like Autism Speaks demonize us. That is why almost none of us support them.
"We dont have enough services to help up once we become adults, the funding just stops, and many of us suffer severely from it, people with autism die on average 30 years younger mainly due to suicide. "
I'm not broken - please don't automatically assume that I need or want to be fixed.
I can't stop it and I didn't have a choice.
It's not always classic movie Rainman autism. Some people are weird and don't know how to not be weird.

The whole shtick about sensory issues.
"There are too many misunderstandings. I would like to reiterate the importance of recognizing the variation among autism spectrum disorders. A complex of phenotypes present in one autistic will not always perfectly mirror another's set of symptoms. To those who do not comprehend this, I do not appear to be autistic.   That aside for now, one of the most difficult ideas to convey is that, sometimes, it is not the autistic who is incapable of empathizing with others; it is also the problem of those who do not have any form of autism who struggle to empathize with those who do. An inability to communicate on the same level as individuals with no ASDs can make expressing empathy in a natural way, to those individuals, an overwhelming challenge. Things break down, or never meet, even when you try your best to forge connections.   This is why animals and human babies are wonderful for someone like me. I don't know if that is common for other people with other forms of autism, though.  "
"Just because I don't act like Sheldon Cooper from Big Bang doesn't mean I'm not autistic. I can act somewhat normally in person, but sarcasm goes right over my fucking head and boundaries are so frustrating to find. "
"We aren't nuts or anything.  I have autism and was told I would never be able to attend school normally due to it.  As it turns out, I sometimes get a little weird, but I'm outwardly normal and most people don't know I'm autistic until I tell them.  We are normal people with a slight difference, like having black hair instead of red or whatever.  We aren't fucking ""retarded"" or whatever, many of us are very similar to normal people."
I forgot:  I need to schedule things. I can't be expected to run an errand for you 10 minutes or even after hour before hand. Throwing things at me like that causes me a ton of stress. Let me know a day ahead of time... Or a week ahead of time if possible. I have to plan out the majority of my day to minimize stress.
SAILS is a totally fraudulent organization
"I was diagnosed in 6th grade and one thing I wish is that everyone would do is just look at the person than at the label and focus on what their weaknesses are and what their strengths are than using their diagnoses to define them. I had to fight to take Drama, Driver's Ed. and I didn't like being set limitations for what jobs I could do and being told I couldn't work at a McDonalds because it's too fast paced and lot of chaos and having to work with people. Just give me a fucking chance and let me try and see what my own limitations are. Hey look at Temple Grandin or Steven Spielberg. I wished I had told them to look her up and read about her. She works with people, she has a people job, she gives speeches so that should show how you shouldn't limit someone based on their diagnoses.   Also another thing that hurt me was when I found out these these girls who would come into the resource room and do projects with me was actually a set up by the teachers just so I could build on my people skills and learn to get along with others and work with others so that meant those girls were not really my friends so that meant it's not that they accepted me, it was all a set up. Doing this sort of buddy system can really back fire so ask the kid about it first and make sure they are okay with it and tell them what you are really doing. To me this all felt so fake when I found out.  "
"pretty high functioning aspergers here i guess the best thing to do is mention when we're going on about something you don't care about, or doing something inappropriate for the situation or taking things too far, because we don't get the warning signs from changes in tone or body language that prevent regular people from falling into these trappings most of the time, and it only takes 1 or 2 times for people to see you doing these things and decide they don't want to be around you or that you are ""annoying"" and it becomes very difficult to change their minds.  side note for schools, at least in my experience all of the obviously disabled kids with conditions like down syndrome were treated very well and respectfully by everyone but it was open season on anything higher functioning, i don't think most people even knew they had any kind of disability, just that they were ""weird"" so it was ok to ridicule them. i was good enough hiding it by that time to avoid a lot of it, but i knew some others who weren't"
"Throwaway account. Dont want friends to know that I have ASD just yet (its a secret I still hold on to even as I approach University). I have high functioning autism in Singapore, where being autistic is a joke thrown around by some people. I find that ppl in SG treat people with disabilities as abnormal people and tend to approach them with a certain level of fear and sympathy. We just wanna be treated like normal people! Autism doesnt mean that we dont know how to socialize, it just means that we could be extra sensitive to our surroundings and oblivious to the social cues of other people at times."
"People saying things like ""what are you, autistic?"" when someone does or says something stupid is extremely harmful to the idea of acceptance of what autism actually is.  The idea that being autistic means you're a drooling drone who can't function. I'm very high functioning and a lot of the things that I do as a result of my autism are often regarded as me being anti social at best and a complete asshole at worst."
"I made this account for my brother and he wants to say some things. This is verbatim from him speaking:  I am different. That I have some difficulty with communication skills but I think of certain subjects that I really like so much. It's just me how to communicate people and how I see things differently.   I'm proud because I am what I am and I am a human being. I would like to try to learn to communicate and be in relationships with people, relationships with women, but I always feel like I will say something without realizing it that will be an effect of my disability. Sometimes it's difficult because its part of my communication skills."
"Emotions. People tend to think I'm emotionless or careless, but the real truth is, I feel way too much at once. And when it starts, I'm stone cold numb from the surreal nature of the situation. After a couple of weeks or so it gets heavier and heavier and I tend to have outbursts or breakdowns.  I fucking hate it. It ruins my relationships, and it also eats my mind away with constant questioning, and my anxiety triples as I constantly feel like fucking vomiting. Or like my heart is about to stop."
"A few questions to the autistic folks out there:  My 6 year old daughter is mildly autistic.  We've known since about 18 mos old and have since had her in intensive therapy, developmental preschool, etc. and she's done very well.  She's not gifted intellectually but she is above average in regular public school and so far is doing pretty good.  Is there anyway to make any sort of prediction of how she'll turn out in the next 5 or 10 years?  I've heard from other parents of relatively high functioning autistic kids that the time around puberty is immensely stressful, more so than typical kids.  Is this your experience too, or not?  I spoke with a high functioning adult about this stuff a while back and he said that a lot of the therapy is directed toward normalizing behavior which he felt was kinda a waste of time.  Any comments?  What do you guys think about?  What's in your mind?  My daughter is fairly bright and is affectionate with the people that she really enjoys (close family and ""friends"" only) but she does not verbalize many of her thoughts, has great difficulty telling us a narrative about what happened during a day at school, etc.  Furthermore, she enjoys being around other kids and can play around them, but a give-and-take interaction just doesn't happen very often.  She doesn't complain about any of the kids in her class, but i don't feel like any of them are actually her ""friend"". Can we reasonably expect any of this to ""improve""?  Sorry, that was too much.  If any of you autistic folks have any comments, it'd be appreciated."
"My biggest issue is always just getting people to listen to what I need at the moment, because depending on stress, mood etc it can be easier or harder to deal with stuff.   If I say please don't touch me, please don't touch me. Chances are I'm already over stimulated and am having trouble dealing with everything going on in my head and that's the last thing I need. If I'm anxious I physically feel pain when someone touches me.  Or like just asking for subtitles on. Is it really that hard to just put them on without playing 20 questions? If your friend asks for subtitles on then they probably need them, even if you think they don't. I have a hard time hearing and interpreting words so if there is too much background noise or it's too fast paced it's really helpful to have subtitles on to keep up. But it's not always comfortable outing myself to people because people tend to look at you differently you know? And I'd rather it get brought up later one on one not in a room full of people wanting to just get the movie started.  tl:dr Respect that if someone says they need something for their own wellbeing/enjoyment, they probably need it and it's none of your business."
"Often, we are in a state where we want to be alone without being lonely. To elaborate: we want to work/relax in solitude, but have someone to contact if you feel like conversation."
