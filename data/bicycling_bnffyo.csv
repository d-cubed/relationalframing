Guess your bike is steal worthy.  You got that going for ya!
"Good to know that chain held out, but I bit longer and your bike would have been gone"
"This is why I use two locks. People give me shit for it, but if you use two they have to cut two. Chances are (for me at least) that there's another bike nearby with only 1 lock. Doesn't mean it won't happen, but I think it helps."
Theivin cunt fuckin bastard reject cocksacks.
"Oh dude! Co-worker posits they broke one side, and the second broke their bolt cutters."
Great abus advertisement
I'm glad they weren't successful
Nice to see the other side...a successful deterrence!
That's almost as viscerally terrifying as discovering a new spot on your scrotum.
Found the Abus viral marketer ;)  Abus locks are the real deal.
Just curious what size links that chain has?  I use a similar one for my cargo bike.
Good old square link chains. Difficult for bolt cutters to grab.

"I have that same lock, makes me feel better about it knowing somebody tried hard and gave up"
Good thing they chose to cut right on the logo otherwise how would we all know which brand to buy.
This is why you need to buy a good lock! If that was some cheap cable lock your bike would've been gone in a second
And that's why you never go cheap on locks!
"Wow. Glad it worked for you. I have the same lock, feels nice to know it's safe."
Man I had a heart attack for a sec— I thought the bottom pic was your front fork at a quick glance lmao. Glad the chain held up for you.
"Dang, we always talk about how heavier duty stuff will just ""slow them down"" but there it is."
I started a holiday in San Fran with gf and we decided to buy Craigslist bikes for the 2mths we were in the US. Took over a cable lock with us naively and locked up the 2 bikes in down town SF. They lasted less than an hour. Really soured SF for us.
"And my bike *did* get stolen today! Must have gave up on yours and found my $10 lock and snipped through it with playdoh scissors.  Thankfully, in a unforeseen move, he left his bike behind and it seems OK. Just a Walmart bike, but it's new and a flat bar road bike. Basically a lateral move for me. My bike was a 7 year old trek that was getting a bit busted. Worth the same as the bike they left behind."
This does not look like the work of ['The Lock Picking Lawyer'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm9K6rby98W8JigLoZOh6FQ)
Worthless pigs!
I have the same chain! This makes me feel like it was the right purchase. Lol.
Damn. Looks like an angle grinder attack possibly
"I have way too much money invested in my dream bike to let some fool steal it. If I ride into town to grab a candy bar I use a cable lock through any  iron fence that’s solid, both wheels and parts of the frame and an Abus D lock through the back tire and the down tube. I throw all of the locks in a small backpack it’s a little heavy, but really not much of burden."
Someone Abused ABUS
"You carry that thing with you ? Wow I have a similar one but I only use it to lock the bike in my shed   Get an ulock, the only way to get through those is an angle grinder."
I have the same lock
Well I just bought and Abus chain as a second lock. Maybe it should be my first lock!
Nice lock. Abus-Abloy doesn't screw around.
I've had two bikes stolen from where I chained them up when going to school so I stopped riding
yeah imma lock my bike on two of these
Glad your bike is ok. Something similar just happened to me.  I live in an apartment building where there is a locked door to a courtyard and the courtyard has a covered bike area.  I walked outside and while leaving I saw a mountain bike on the other side of the courtyard and double-taked when I realized it was mine. Went to investigate and found someone cut my thin cable that I had going through the bike rack attached to the U-Lock between wheel/frame. U-lock still there but with a gash in it. Guessing they thought it wasnt worth it.  Then I saw two other cut locks next to the rack. They were not so lucky. =(  My bikes all now live in my office and the incident convinced my wife Im not just being paranoid.
someone spooked them.
Similar thing happened to me. Good that I had an Abus lock too!
German made
"Wow,  I wonder how much time they spent working on this lock..."
Has anybody here tried anti-theft devices that track the stolen bike real time on a smartphone app?
"If you have a nice bike, you can easily avoid having it stolen by covering it in cheap gold spray paint. Works like a charm for me."
Nice!
For the for the haters that say bolt cutters can’t cut it https://youtu.be/pywN558dJaU
"Are most bike thieves drug addicts, or just general assholes?   Is there any sort of study about bike thieves?     They're basically the lowest form of thieves.   If you steal a car or from a store the objects are insured.    Some poor bastard that needs that bike to get to work is going to have to shell out their own money to buy a new one.  When I'd steal stuff as a kid, my code was to only take something from a corporation."
It's amazing how far owners of bikes have to go to protect their bikes.  Laws protect the thief more than the owners.  Otherwise locks with mace would be activated when the locks are tampered with and/or shocked to the point they couldn't tolerate.  Bike owners would go to jail immediately. Sucks.
