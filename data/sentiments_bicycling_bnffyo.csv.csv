bicycling_bnffyo.csv,Glad your bike is ok. Something similar just happened to me.  I live in an apartment building where there is a locked door to a courtyard and the courtyard has a covered bike area.  I walked outside and while leaving I saw a mountain bike on the other side of the courtyard and double-taked when I realized it was mine. Went to investigate and found someone cut my thin cable that I had going through the bike rack attached to the U-Lock between wheel/frame. U-lock still there but with a gash in it. Guessing they thought it wasnt worth it.  Then I saw two other cut locks next to the rack. They were not so lucky. =(  My bikes all now live in my office and the incident convinced my wife Im not just being paranoid.,0.9999822378158569

bicycling_bnffyo.csv,"Are most bike thieves drug addicts, or just general assholes?   Is there any sort of study about bike thieves?     They're basically the lowest form of thieves.   If you steal a car or from a store the objects are insured.    Some poor bastard that needs that bike to get to work is going to have to shell out their own money to buy a new one.

bicycling_bnffyo.csv,It's amazing how far owners of bikes have to go to protect their bikes.  Laws protect the thief more than the owners.
