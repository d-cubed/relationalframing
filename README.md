# relationalframing
Behaviorists have always been at the cutting edge of technology and data analysis. However, the number of behaviorists who code isn’t exactly overwhelming. Adapting work from Ian Hussey*, I developed a small worked example of programmatic sentiment analysis and relational frame identification for  ABAI 2019. I’ve adapted the examples somewhat for this post.

The underlying goals here are to:
Get lots of data - scrape conversations about topics of interest i.e. scraper.py
Visualize how people talk about those topics in informative ways
Visualization includes: 
sentiment analysis - how positive and negative [there are basically 50 million tutorials about this] 
the relationships expressed regarding the topic, i.e. its relational framing

1. scraper.py - grabs data from reddit - you'll need your own credetnials and submission IDs
